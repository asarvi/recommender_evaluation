B000UZVX92	Excellent product. Nice feel and fits exactly. Its a little confusing to put on though. However the seller has a video on youtube to guide you. The link is in the receipt. **** I highly recommend watching the video and following the instructions****. I would not have been able to figure out how to put this on without watching the video. Use a credit card or similar-sized cardboard piece to drive out bubbles as you put the screen in.  Managed to put it on with only a tiny corner bubble.It does take patience and skill to make sure you put this without bubbles.  If you do get one (as I did, or it is slightly misaligned as I did too) you can pull back the sheet halfway and start again.  Of course, once it is on, you cannot pull it back i imagine.  People who are complaining about bubbles either did not watch the video or were not patient/skillful.  I imagine that would be a problem with any other screen as well.The plastic has a nice sheen to it.  It feels smooth on the fingers.  I prefer this feel to the original cover.  It does tend to smudge a little, but somehow the smudges are not visible when the phone is in use (the light seems to hide them).  All in all, this is a much better cover than the original that comes with the phone.
B000UZVX92	The title doesn't mention that it's only for iphone 3G or 3GS. It won't fit your old iphone.
B000UZVX92	The protector they sent me did not fit the 3GS screen.  The cutouts were in the wrong place so I had to choose to either partially cover the speaker or the home button.
B000UZVX92	i think this screen protector is great. I was really skeptical about buying one on line but this one is definitely worth it since the ones in the apple store cost about 15 dollars. this fits the iphone perfect and the hole for the ear piece is slightly bigger to allow the sensor that is located there to work better. I had no bubbles when I put it on and it feels as if there is no screen protector on the glass after all is said and done. I'm about to order a few more just to have and to give to my sister and friends. Great Product!
B000UZVX92	I'm one of the most clumsy people in the world, and this item has resisted all of it. It was easy to apply, I'm not sure why so many other people had problems. It took me maybe 3 tries to get one tiny bubble out since it was bothering me, but it wasn't hard to do at all. It fits perfectly and there are absolutely no problems with the touch sensors. Everything works just great!
B000UZVX92	The photos show 2 films for a 1st generation iPhone. They sent me one film for a 3G phone. It's not even the brand that is shown in the photos.Beware the 5 star reviews - sounds like the seller is doing some self promotion!
B000UZVX92	This product never claimed in its description that it was meant for a 3G iPhone!! Just says it's for an iPhone. Okay.....Bought it and now stuck with it (costs more to send it back and get refund ). This product doesn't fit the 1st generation iPhone!!!!  Don't buy it.
B000UZVX92	This screen guard gets the job done, but you will get disappointed if you hate bubbles. It was used for my first generation iPhone (also known as the iPhone 2G)Firstly, the screen guard protects against scratches and scuffs you would get from normal wear and tear. However, scratch marks can show up after a while and the oils from your fingers can show up pretty easily. Just be sure to have fairly clean fingers and to not put your iPhone in the same pocket with your keys.The most disconcerting part is during the application of the guard on the iPhone. Just getting the tiniest mote of dust will create a visible bubble in the screen. I made the mistake of applying it in a dusty living room with the fan happening to be turned on to make matters worse.HOWEVER, those with bubbles or if you haven't applied it yet, listen here: do it in a bathroom with hot water from the shower running to make steam. I remember reading somewhere online that a steamy environment lessens or drops the dust in the room. For those of you wanting to reapply it, there is still hope: lightly rinse the screen guard's adhesive side under warm water in the steamed up bathroom to wash nearly all of the dust particles off. Wipe the iPhone's screen with a microfiber cloth, reapply the cleaned guard, and rub the water bubbles out with a credit card. You may or may not be able to get every speck off, but it makes for a more tolerable application with less bubbles. If you are applying the guard for the first time, just do the whole thing in the steamy bathroom without rinsing it; you're in the perfect environment to do so.Overall, it's a basic but working screen protector. If you really want to be more serious in protecting your iPhone screen, I would invest in a Zagg Invisible Shield.
B000UZVX92	This screen protector holds up really well and any blemishes buff right out.If it gets dirty I just take it off and wash it with a little soap and water, let it dry and go over it with a microfiber cloth.Great product especially for the price.
B000UZVX92	I am not a fan of screen protectors but figured I would give it a try. I was not happy with this item from a cosmetic standpoint it made the screen to appear washed out, from a mechanical standpoint getting a 100% bubble and dust free application is not one I could accomplish.
B000UZVX92	This Screen protector is just a good as the ones they sell at apple, at a fraction of the price. Buys this if you don't have one, or currently have an anti-glare. It looks great!
B000UZVX92	I actually never used it but here is why.  When I finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it.  Like the mail man folded it, laid in on the street, backed up right on top of it, and proceeded to power brake and burn out on top of it.  needless to say the screen had unfixable creases and was barely still in the wrapper.it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed.
B000UZVX92	This is a great product for the iPhone, it's shipment was fast and in good condition.  Thanks
B000UZVX92	This works as advertised.  I thought there would be more than one in the package but that is my fault for not reading the desciption.I am using this on the 3G IPhone and it works just fine.
B000UZVX92	Don't know what the size difference between the 1st gen and 3g is but I'm currently using it on iphone 3g. It may be a few millimeters short but if you use one of those rubber cases in addition to the screen protector it is just perfect.
B000UZVX92	It protects your iPhone.  The only problem is it already has scratches on it.  You'd think that buying something new, it would be new.
B000UZVX92	this is a good screen protector for the iphone. comes with cleaning cloth. works well with my protective case.
B000UZVX92	The product is good.It fits my 2G Iphone perfectly.I have no complaints on the product.I only have one complaint about the merchant (Bargaincell), they took forever to ship the product, did not keep me statused AT ALL on the shipping process.
B000UZVX92	This is a great LCD screen protector for the iPhone 2G (1st Gen.) I am very happy with this.-Alan Reiley[...]
B000UZVX92	I followed the instructions perfectly and the plastic rolled off the first time I put it in my pocket.  Complete waste of money.
B000UZVX92	For the price you get a very good product!! It's very durable and it hardly scratchs. Well worth the money. It also brings a little wipe to clean it once in a while and a little cardboard to eliminate bubbles when you are putting the film into the screen (That's in case any bubble appear).Its very good, i like it a lot and i will buy more again
B000UZVX92	When I saw that this item was coming at a dime a dozen, I jumped at the opportunity. However the shipping came up to almost 3 times the amount i expected and within the individual packages NONE of them had the little card that is supposed to assist you in putting them on (and the instructions make reference to it). I made do with what had and it came out ok. Its a good product but I would look around a little more before I buy this.
B000UZVX92	These work great but are not reusable. In fact you must make sure that you attempt this on a hard clean surface like a kitchen countertop. Clean it off then use the included wipe to clean all the smudges and stuff off of the phone. Then remove the backing on the protector and put it on. if as much as a molecule of dust gets under it then you have an air bubble forever. Good luck.
B000UZVX92	The screen protector is almost identical to the item shown in the picture. However, there is a slit in the screen protector beneath the home key hole instead of a neat round hole.
B000UZVX92	TOO LARGE.This does not fit correctly.  It is approx. 1mm too long and too wide to properly seal to the surface of the iPhone screen.  After several aggravating attempts to make it work properly, I gave up and am now searching for a better screen protector.I have been using PDAs and smartphones for almost 10 years, and always have used screen protectors whenever available.  This is simply the worst I've ever purchased.
B000UZVX92	I placed an order for the 3G version but received the 2G version instead.  Futhermore, the all the ten pieces received has defect - there was no "hole" for the earpiece position. Had to "modify" by cutting partially the top portion to fit the 3G iphone.  Am quite dissappointed with the purchase.Regards.Christopher SeahEmail : clseah2005@yahoo.comPhone : 65-8181 1972
B000UZVX92	The description is for iPhone screen protectors. I got iTouch screen protectors which do not fit the iphone and and are larger. now i have to get the right ones again!
B000UZVX92	I thought I was buying invisibleshield from Zagg.  Not so, this nasty little shield is from China.  Buyer beware!!!
B000UZVX92	There are 2 big problems1) No matter how meticulously I try removing the bubbles, most of them never seem to go away.2) After peeling off the top cover the film is so sticky that it collects so much dust on the  surface and completely clouds the lcdIt did not come as 3 layers , just 2 in a plastic pouch
B000UZVX92	This screen protector is very simple to apply, it has only one peel off backing sheet that makes it easy to place at the starting point (I started at the top over the ear hole). No air bubbles, and hard to even tell it's there! Want easy? Get this screen protector for your iPhone!
B000UZVX92	I've ordered a few of these already (multiple malfunctioning iPhones) so it's about time I wrote a review... They work just as advertised, I've gone through 3 of these now and every time just applied it in a few seconds and it stays on with no problem. Buy this if you need a screen protector.
B000UZVX92	Excellent protection and the price can't be beat.As rough as I am with a phone I think I'll order a few more as a backup.
B000UZVX92	This type of screen protector is good enough to protect the screen but it is too shiny and picks up all finger prints or smudges. There is an anti glare screen sold at the Apple Store that is $15 bucks and is a PERFECT fit and does NOT show smudges. If you want cheap 1 cent plus $3 bucks shipping this is the one for you. If you really want to protect your screen and not have to keep cleaning off the protector so you can actually SEE the screen, then get the $15 set of 2 screens from the Apple Store.
B000UZVX92	Product's quality is best you can get.  I never bought one of these protector films before so i was clueless.  Its a little tricky to get it on at first, but u can keep peeling it off and retrying without a problem. Make sure you are working in lint-free area because thats the only trouble you might have.  It can also works with my new completely covered ivyskin case. Recommend to anyone in a heart beat! just buy it its cheap with the greatest quality.  No brainer!
B000UZVX92	Don't waste money, time, effort for it...Product life is max 3 day, bubbles never lose, easily scratching and peeling...
B000UZVX92	This screen protector is very good for what I paid.  It came with a lint free cleaning cloth as well that helped before application.  It certainly does the job, and it took one try to get it on fairly well.  I had to readjust it once, but it was no problem, it didn't mess it up by peeling it back a little and sticking it back down.  It really went on easy and fit well.  It will feel like there is a little more friction than the glass but this is not a big deal at all.  The screen responds to your touch just as well as if there was no screen protector.
B000UZVX92	I was very happy with the protector and if instructions are followed, works perfect!I didn't line mine up all the way but there were no air bubbles = )
B000UZVX92	The reviewers complaining here about the 'stickers' might not realize that this comes as one protector with 3 pieces of film, you remove back film to expose the adhesive by grabbing the sticker and peeling back, you position the film on the iphone (mine fit perfectly) then you rub with the plastic tab they give you to remove the bubbles, and yes, they do all come out. Finally you remove the 3rd sheet of film from the outside by grabbing its tab and peeling it off, this way you don't risk scratching the protector while rubbing down the bubbles.The skin actually seems to trap less oil and smudges than the original screen BUT it is much shinier. Don't know if that will lessen over time, and is a minor annoyance, but well worth it. Seems very durable, I've tossed it in pockets with keys, coins etc and no scratches. Well worth the money.
B000UZVX92	I was hesitant to buy this at first because I read bad reviews and thought the good ones were fake or something, but I decided to buy it anyway because of the price.There is one screen cover in it. I expected to need to trim it cause someone said that it was too large in their review, but I think they were just incompetent or something because it fits perfectly and left no residue. There was maybe one bubble that came right out with the little plastic card it comes with. It took maybe two tries to get it on right, and it's not peeling away or anything. This is an amazing deal for the price in my opinion. Don't waste your money on the apple one that costs like $15 or something, this is a perfect fit and also shows no residue from fingerprints.I recommend cleaning your iPhone with an alcohol lens cleaning cloth before applying the cover.
B000UZVX92	the product wasn't for the iphone at all. no hole was punched out for the ear piece.you get what you pay for i suppose.
B000UZVX92	I have tried several,, this one is clear and smoth.It's missing a strong plastic card for clearing bubble, but you can use any of your personal credit card :-) :-) ...
B000UZVX92	I used it on my LG cu980 so i had to cut some parts of it. its been over two months now. it still looks great & doesn't reduce the touch screen sensitivity. Highly recommended!
B000UZVX92	You only have to be careful when placing the film. You don't want to drop hair or dust because it will be noticed and a bubble will be made.
B000UZVX92	there are things that is as easy to accomplish as it seems, but there are also things that seems stupidly mindless but in fact it require the skills of a swiss watch maker. putting on a screen protector is surly one of those moment which you have to be complete prepare, stress-free to do so. You don't have to many chances to mess this up. However, this screen protector comes with two covers to protect the screen protector itself; this not only make sure you can align the sheet with your iPhone correctly, but also makes the application process easier as you can hold the front tap as you pull away the back cover and apply pressure with a credit card of some sort (all of these will seems clear once you see the actual product)HOWEVER, the screen protector does NOT match the facade dimension of an iPhone 3G. It is about 1/16" smaller on both top and bottom and 1/8" smaller on each transverse side. If you have a silicon case, like me, than it is not too bad, it can cover up the gap fairly nicely. There is also a gap at the bottom of the home button, which mean it does not cover the entire surface. But if you are planning on using the screen protector by itself, think twice. There are protector out there that have better coverage, but for the price of this product I will pass.
B000UZVX92	The product fits well and so far (about a month) it has proven to be pretty durable.
B000UZVX92	After a while it starts to buckle a little. Would I buy again? YES you can't beat the price.
B000UZVX92	Very good protector. Liked so well I ordered a few more for future use. The people complaining must have done something wrong. Befor applying, the screen must be very clean and no dust. If any air bubbles appear just use a credit card edge to remove them.
B000UZVX92	Honestly you can't get any better for this price.  It's easy to apply and cleans off easy.  I had some screen protectors left over from my palm pilot that worked great on my iPod, but no so great on the iPhone.  I thought I would have a lot of trouble putting it on, but it practically put itself on.  Once I aligned it properly, I just let go of the tab and it adheared all on it's own.  I just had to smooth out a couple of bubbles that disappeared quickly, and with little difficulty.  I also learned, after I got it, that it is reuseable.  Meaning, if you desire, you can take it off, wash it and reapply it.  I did not know, and purchased two, but they are so inexpensive . . . who cares!!!  Next cheapest product at the time of my purchase was $11.99, and disposable.  Like hand-held screen protectors, the more expensive ones are designed to wear out, leading to future purchases.  Excellent product!  I couldn't be more satisfied with it.
B000UZVX92	This serves the purpose of protecting the screen just fine on the 3G phone.As other reviews have mentioned, it is a slight bit narrow, but still covers all of the lcd screen.Awesome price alternative to what Apple sells in the store as well.
B000UZVX92	The screen protector is serving the purpose. The product arrived on time and "no-hassle" purchase through Amazon.
B000UZVX92	alright first of all I just want to clear some stuff up because some people just don't have common sense. First there is only 1 protector in the package, the protector has 2 masks over it 1 on each side the masks have a pull tab over them indcating which to take off first. Second I found it easier to peel off a little off the top of the first mask to line it up with the home button or speaker which ever side u start with its up to u, then once you line it up right as you are peeling drag your finger or credit card to press on the screen so no air will enter while you put the screen on then you might see tiny bubbles you can ignore them and after 2 or 3 days they will go or you can use a card to push them out. I would to add another thing that the film actually improves scrolling. I have rough hands and after I put the screen on my finger glides across the screen. I will definetly buy 2 more just incase. Buy this product you won't regret it. Cheers!
B000UZVX92	I bought this product for my iphone 3G since it didn't say anything about 1st generation when I bought it.  It is slightly smaller than the phone which actually was to my advantage.  It fits the main screen perfectly but just doesn't go out to the edges for the 3G which works great still.  Easy instructions definitely.  Took me a few times to put it on put once it was on and I got all the bubbles out, it's worked out perfectly so far.  It's not trying to peel off. As long as you read the instructions/view the video, you're good.  Not rocket science here.  You do need patience though if you get bubbling but I'm assuming you get that with any screen protector?For the price, you can't be beat.
B000UZVX92	Well, I'm being cheapo on things like this picked up this crappy film and of course, it easily came off after 3 days of use. It's very hard plastic that have practically no static properties to it - it won't stick to the screen if even a bit dirty. I used Cozip Slim Fit Case that protects the back and sides (nice case) but not front of the iPhone. Also, many bubbles are hard to get rid off when trying to stick this film. Next time I will seek a thin rubbery plastic that will stick and stay in place. Verdict for this product: NOT RECOMMENDED.
B000UZVX92	The film was pre scratched and there should be two layers of polythenebut there is only one
B000UZVX92	Those people that complain about this product not working or doesnt fit or the edges would not adhere, or bubbles remained under it simply did NOT know what they were doing.  So they leave a rather negative review?  Follow the instructions folks.  If you cant do something this simple, ask someone else to help you.  My iPhone is protected.  Thanks!
B000UZVX92	It was so easy to install and fits the Iphone 3G perfectly. It's much sturdier than the phone's screen and wipes clean easily. Not sure why they listing says "Not for 3G"
B000UZVX92	I've had this on my iPhone since the day it came in the mail. It doesn't interfere with the touch interface, and it even keeps fingerprints off pretty well too!
B000UZVX92	Easy to put on the phone, fits great and is unnoticeable when used with a phone cover such as the rubber one on amazon.  At first I thought there was a difference in the screen sensitivity after applying this but after a day or so I don't notice it at all.  The screen doesn't get smudged up so much by my hands or face with this protector on.  Great value!
B000UZVX92	This product is a little difficult to apply but for the money, it is a great value.  I've had it on my phone for about 6 months and I'm here buying another one. I'm very hard on my phone and I'm glad this is protecting my screen.
B000UZVX92	First of all, I have added an image that you can use to judge the size of the protector on an iPhone 3G. I know it's hard to see a clear protector in a small photo, but in the image my iPhone is inthis case, which perfectly covers the edges of the screen protector on all sides, so there's no chance of pulling up the corners or getting dust, etc. around the edges of the protector.  There's a cut out semi-circle for the Home button.The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm, for example). It's not the flimsy, flexible stuff.  For example, if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper, then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.The upshot of this is that you don't have to worry about corners folding or bubbles forming during application. You can position it very precisely before applying, and then when you apply, you get a PERFECT result, straight with no bubbles whatsoever.The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice, so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness), you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card.  To be honest though, it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway.  It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.So you get a high quality, crystal clear, bubble-free, scratch resistant protector that will easily outlast a normal screen protector, and will probably outlast a PACK of normal screen protectors.  And you basically get it for the cost of shipping.It's a no-brainer. Get it and thank me later. :-)UPDATE 10/10/2008:  Apparently the seller is no longer selling the 3G version here.  My review applied to the 3G version that was being sold on this page at the time the review was submitted.  I'm sure that the review of the material, etc. still applies though.
B000UZVX92	I usually get the $1 pack that includes 5. I always liked those and it seemed every 2 weeks it would have to many scratches on them. I only place my ipod in my pocket during school hours, but when I pull it out of the pocket there are many scratches. This product is way better! You have to carefully place it on. I placed it on (usually need to on the 5 of them because bubbles form very easy) very easily. I've used then for about a week or 2, and I don't see a single scratch. i do have one issue, since this model was the cheapest, I bought it. I have an ipod touch 3rd gen. The whole circle is really big in the cutout, and it seems to be just a little longer than my screen. On the ipod where there's a gap from the screen and the metal, well the screen protector touches the metal so dust can easily be attracted to the bottom and very top, but it doesn't get on the screen. Overall I'm impressed, and I'd love to buy more since it was only $1 including shipping.
B000UZVX92	Was supposed to come with three protectors, only one was in the package.  I put it on exactly as instructed and it still had bubbles, edges never sealed and kept peeling up.  I tore it off within 36 hours.  Do not buy this product.
B000UZVX92	I can't believe I wasted my time and money buying this. I put it on exactly how the instructions showed and it left bubbles all over the screen. It was supposed to come with three screen protectors but it only came with one.It also has a very noticeable discoloration when you look at it from an angle.I don't know how this got such good reviews.
B000UZVX92	Cheap and does the job. Well satisfied as a customer. As a suggestion to those buying, when applying the film, have one of those keyboard aerosol dusters handy and very dry hands.
B000UZVX92	I received this screen guard for my first generation iphone. I am not impressed. It did not go on that easily and it has always had bubbles that I cannot get rid of.
B000UZVX92	The first product received was incorrect. But, this supplier made it right the second time around.  The screen protector is a good quality one.Will recommend for purchase.
B000UZVX92	I just needed a cheap little cover for my original iphone that we were letting the kid use as an ipod.  Worked well and prolonged it's life a bunch!
B000UZVX92	This would be fine if it fit right.  They made the width of this EXACTLY this same with as the screen size for the iPhone.  The problem is that if you are one nanometer off to either side during the application, the whole thing is blown and you have to throw it away.  Trust me, you will be off by at least a nanometer and your screen protector will be sitting up on the outside frame of the phone on one side leaving bubbles underneath.  This could have been better produced.  Try another one.
B000UZVX92	What else can I say? It went on without any bubbles on 2nd attempt and does what it is meant to do. Can't ask for more than that, especially at $.14 plus shipping. I tried the more expensive one here on Amazon and it was a nightmare. Hope this helps.
B000UZVX92	Great -- definately worth buying.Apple Iphone Screen LCD Protector Film Guard Sold By Topdeals888
B000UZVX92	This protector is cheap - so the price is nice, however - as they say, you get what you pay for.  I ended up throwing it away after 2 weeks.  It is worth the money to buy the one from Apple - it lasted me a year and a half.
B000UZVX92	I had no problem "installing" this screen protector.  I am very pleased with the protection it's provided even with keys and coins in the same pocket.  It does not change the interaction with the screen and does not require any additional pressure to interact with the phone.
B000UZVX92	While this item is only about $3 with shipping, I would never recommend it.  We spent about 40 minutes trying to apply the plastic sheet, which unfortunately arrived with a sticker attached to it (so that portion of the adhesive already had an issue).  There are bubbles everywhere that we have not been able to get rid of.  All I can do is wait to get another protective sheet, because this one certainly could not look worse than it currently does.  I wish that I could give it no stars.
B000UZVX92	For someone like me who will easily scratch my iPhone screen, this is the product for me.  It is inexpensive and I think Apple should make it a standard accessory that comes with the iPhone  :)
B000UZVX92	This screen protector is one of the best kinds of protectors you can get, and as the previous reviewer says, it comes with three layers. One to expose the adhesive side, and the other to remove from the phone once you place it on the phone to protect it from scratches when removing bubbles.However, like any screen film these are some things to consider. Make sure you purchase at least 3, because putting it on is a real pain. You need to make sure no dust or dirt gets on the sticky side and you must also make sure you place it on perfectly as it should be placed on or otherwise you are going to have a bit sticking over the sides which doesn't work so well with some cases.If you manage to do that correctly, you will have a pretty good film protecting it and you won't realize it's there. It's also good at protecting against little CD-like scratches. So I dock it a star for difficulty to place perfectly on your phone.
B000UZVX92	Product is terrible, shipping is way to expensive, 100$ on 5$ purchase, if you are smart you will not buy from this seller...
B000UZVX92	This is two plastic covers that bubble and will not stay on I-Phone. I guess you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this.
B000UZVX92	Fits on the phone exactly and I had zero problems with air bubbles.  It was so cheap that I bought 2 and the quality is such that I do not anticipate using the other one anytime soon.  The only grip is that they charge WAY too much for shipping and then it took mine 14 days to get here, suckage! I guess it was worth the wait.
B000UZVX92	I was using on my iphone 3G and loved it!  It was slightly smaller than the screen, but it completely covered all the areas I would be touching!  I think when I bought mine, it didn't have all the "Not for 3G disclaimers."  My iphone died and I had to exchange it and am definitely buying another for my new phone, it really protected against smudges and my make up smears! And it was much easier to wipe clean!
B000UZVX92	I have only purchased this item because it last and it is easy to apply. Plus it is the cheapest you will ever find. I have reccomend it to all my friends and family.
B000UZVX92	A sales rep at my local electronics store sold me on a super pricey protector ($22 +tax for ONE) after I brought back a cheaper one because of all the air bubbles. I assumed for the price the protector would be excellent & I didn't mind the price to protect my recent investment in an iPhone. After carefully reading the directions I applied the $22 protector; The process was quite tedious & messy with the provided spray. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the result. My phone looked & felt like it had a clear orange peel on the screen. I gave it a week & finally returned it to the store. I came home & searched Amazon & found this protector by iKross. I paid a little over $4 & BargainCell got it to me within 3 days. I was excited to get the package this afternoon but dreaded applying it to my phone. I worried for nothing... This protector went on perfectly the first try with absolutely no air bubbles!!! You can't even see it... Its absolutely incredible! WELL worth the money.. Could EASILY be sold for more!
B000UZVX92	you get what you pay for..this is a cheap worthless product. At least it only costs a few cents..made my phone look all bubbly, took it off immediately..I'm not a fan.
B000UZVX92	I bought this about 4 or 5 months ago from Amazon (BargainCell) for less than a dollar +plus shipping; followed the instructions - cleaned the iphone, wiped it clean with the given cloth and applied the screen. Screen goes in very nicely and no air bubbles. It has been more than four months and the screen still has no air bubbles and is protecting the screen very well.Another advantage is that this screen smudges MUCH less compared to the original iphone screen and so it doesn't look that bad. (still you need to clean the surface with moist paper or something once in a week or so).A great buy!
B000UZVX92	The film works great. To put it on WITHOUT any bubbles, you put the film on the phone slowly, starting on one side of the phone and working toward the other,use your finger to slowly push out any bubbles as they form. You must also make sure your phone glass is clean and dust free. It might take you a try or two. The film is also very close to the actual size of the actual iphone glass, so it must be applied straight and true to the glass or it will overlap and need to be re applied.It isnt hard, it just takes a little attention. This film works just as good as the ones priced for $15 at the apple store for a fraction of that price.
B000UZVX92	I found this screen protector very easy to apply. Even though the title says "Not for 3G" it fits my iPhone 3G just fine. I also bought a skin since I tend to throw the phone in my purse.
B000UZVX92	This is an excellent product to protect the screen from scratching. Sets clear and clean on the iPhone screen, you barely notice it...
B000UZVX92	I found that this product, while very good overall, is a little tricky to put on your iPhone.  Unfortunately, I got a couple of air bubbles under my cover and since there is only one screen cover you don't get a second change.  So I recommend making sure that you understand how to apply the cover before unpealing anything.
B000UZVX92	This is a great little product and the installation couldn't be more fool-proof. It took me 3 minutes from opening the packaging until it was successfully applied. The product, made in Japan, has a very minimalist package and not nearly as wasteful as you'd expect if it were an American product. The English for the instructions was a little off, but still understandable. I have to say that I put it on a little off-center (I'm not a perfectionist) and since it doesn't go to the edge on a 3G iPhone, it's really not an issue. You just have to clean the phone first (with the included wipe), line it up, remove the bottom layer incrementally then firmly and smoothly apply the film, and presto!You can't beat the price, and it's as good as what you'd get for $10 or $15 in the store. I bought two because they were so cheap, but I think almost anybody would be safe with just one.
B000UZVX92	Good product, easy to apply IF you know what you're doing. I found a video on youtube that gives a good idea of how to apply it correctly.[...]
B000UZVX92	Ended up throwing in to the garbage. Waste of money. Cover is very thin. There is no way to avoid having bubbles. Not recommended.
B000UZVX92	This screen is not a great deal. You receive a dirty screen cover that does not fit correctly to the edges of the IPhone 2G. The screen guard  is visibly scratched out of the packaging and has a terrible surface feel when applied.I found it even made the screen hard to see from certain angles. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra on a real screen cover. This one is not worth the time and the cost of shipping.
B000UZVX92	You have to read the instructional very carefully. They are very confusing if like me this is your first screen guard. I don't know if its possible to completely remove, but there is always at least one air bubble. At least for me the bubbles are off screen.
B000UZVX92	I have been thru 3 different brands and this is the only one I could get on in a satisfactory manner. I thought the 3 sheet method of application was way easier to use. After I had applied it I actually thought that the thing was not on. I had to hold it up to the light to see the edge. Seems to not show finger smudges. They are cheap and work well what else can I ask for. Glad I bought 3.
B000UZVX92	The reason why I gave this product 3 stars is that IT ISNT BIGGER/WIDER than your iPhone, its smaller.. (Hopefully you people know how to place the protector correctly).. (line it up with your home button..) With that said, I didnt read the direction for peeling it off and got dust in it.. So I tried everything you could possibly think of doing gettin the dust off.. But it still showed up when you go to a blank/white screen.. Overall, if I had read/known about the peeling off - I would of gave this 5 stars.. PLUS - Mine only came with one protector - didnt know it should of came with three - WTF!!
B000UZVX92	I received one of these (labeled blueharbor screen protector, looks different than picture above) and was really shocked. The sticker hasnt got three but only two layers (one sticker, one paper, I am definite on that after ripping several apart). If you peel the one for the screen off an put it on your phone you will find yourself with approx. 600 little bubbles that will never ever go away. Also, it looks really hazy and reduces your brightness by about 30 percent. Also, there is no little squeezer with it. This is just a ridiculous product. Its cheap, but you still would expect it to work, wouldnt you?
B000UZVX92	An excellent product! To those who like to keep safe your screen that's a great solution! Highly recommended
B000UZVX92	Perfect fit. Leaves adequate space for menu button and ear speaker. Slightly difficult to install and align perfectly, but fits wonderfully when done appropriately.
B000UZVX92	I believe the mixed reviews regarding the protector being too large and having air bubbles along the edge could be because slightly different protectors are being sold.  These 'no name' screen protectors are a dime a dozen, and with ~20 different sellers listed, it's very likely we're receiving different ones (even the pictures show different packaging).I order 4 of these from Wireless Central and received "Hh ScreenGUARD" by "The Perfect Solitions". None of them included the card to push out the bubbles (no big deal).I originally ordered just one which after applying a few times to line it up perfectly, dust ended up on the adhesive.  The packaging states "Washable and Reusable", but at the time I couldn't find an easy way to dry it after washing (water spots or lint from the towel), I ordered 3 more hoping to get one right (or always can use a spare).While I was waiting for the 2nd order, I watched a YouTube video in a review by M. Davantes, which again said the film is washable.  I also saw that the invisibleSHIELD uses some type of mist while applying, which gave me the idea to apply it while still wet.HOW TO WASHFirst I scrubbed it with my thumbs while running it under the sink.  I didn't use any soap since it may leave a film or strip the adhesive.  I then shook as much water off as possible while holding it by the edge.  Then dried the top side to see how much water was left on the adhesive side, which was just a bunch of tiny drops left over.  I then applied it to the screen while pushing the water towards the edges, away from the home button and the top handset speaker.  It came out dust free, and the only bubble I got was at the lower right, below the screen :)I believe it's possible to get it bubble free, but it has to be lined up ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  The one little bubble I have in the bottom corner is barely noticeable, and tolerable considering the countless times I was getting it towards the center.If you want something that will fit better with less frustration, you may want to look elsewhere.
B000UZVX92	this product was much too difficult to apply. I never could get all the air bubbles out. The directions were complicated, too many things to peel off in a certain order. In the process of attempting to apply the screen protector I got dust underneath which made the product unusable and I eventually gave up and threw it away.
B000UZVX92	This product is Great,.....It does what it claims it should.Maybe a few more in the pack would be appreciated.Thanks ...
B000UZVX92	I would highly recommend this product for anyone with an iPhone. This screen protector lets you to safeguard the glass screen from any scratches while still allowing you to show off the phone.Once it's applied, you hardly even notice it's there. Aside from a small break underneath the 'home' button, it fits the screen perfectly.
B000UZVX92	Its terrible. Mine did not have two sticker front and back.No tape to mark one and two. This is a scam do not buy this product. [...]Do not buy this it doesn't work...I repeat stay away..
B000UZVX92	I have used screen protectors for Sony PSP.Not all of the were the best, I guess this is not the Best.has air bubbles arround the ear phone and the cancel button.
B000UZVX92	the cover arrived but had a sticker attached to the protector film which made impossible to use. Bad quality, but was shipped really fast during x-mais.
B000UZVX92	Despite careful application, this peeled off my wife's iPhone within a month.  I have been using an InvisibleShield screen protector for 2 years and highly recommend it instead - you get what you pay for.
B000UZVX92	I sat at the Apple Genius Bar and a man stated that he wished he had gotten a screen protector because he had scratched the face of his iphone. Recently, I had to replace my iphone and this product peeled right off and went on my new iphone. I love this product and it is doing exactly what it is supposed to do...protect the face of my iphone. Just use a credit card and tape to put it on to get it straight and remove the air bubbles.
B000UZVX92	Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try. Terrible quality, but better than nothing at all. I recommend you look elsewhere. To be clear on the product contents, I received a pack of 3 individually wrapped screen protectors. Each pack has 2 layers: the screen protector & the paper backing. The screen protectors are very flimsy, they scratch very easily and leaves LOTS of bubbles on your screen. I tried the ever popular credit card application and it ended up scratching the first two I tried to put on (luckily it came with 3). Once you scratch the screen protector, it skews the colors appear underneath the scratch, so the longer you use it, the worse it gets. The last attempt I just used my finger with the included microcloth to apply the protector and it left tiny bubbles on the screen and they don't appear to be leaving anytime soon.
B000UZVX92	When I opened the shipping envelope I got worried because the packaging looks incredibly cheap, like you'd pick up this item from a cell phone store in Chinatown that stocks products no RadioShack or Best Buy would even consider selling. The screen itself is slightly oversized, so you're bound to have air bubbles trapped on one side or the other. The product package claims there is a "provided installation card" that should help smooth out the bubbles. No such card was provided. It took several attempts to get the screen to look decent, but several attempts means fingerprints and dust inevitably make their way to the underside of the screen, making them difficult to remove. I felt ripped off by this product.
B000UZVX92	This product is larger than the iPhone.  It overlaps the edges of the screen as well as the metal bezel.  Even when using care and removing all the bubbles there is a gap/bubble around the entire edge of the screen as the bezel is a millimeter higher than the screen itself.  Although NOT the fault of the seller, I would imagine that with this many poor reviews that would simply stop selling this item.  I didn't pay shipping and the cost was $1.03 cents. Waste of a dollar.
B000UZVX92	Good product, must have if you want to protect your iPhone especially for resale value. I always had one on my first generation and it kept the LCD prestine. It even worked on my 3G iPhone just a little short around the edges but with my speck skin its fully protected.
B000UZVX92	There is not much to say, I've used many of similar products. The one I got is a "Screen Guard" by "Hh". All of the screen protectors are somewhat difficult to put in perfectly, but this one went straight to trash - IT IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER THEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. Yes, it is for the FIRST GENERATION iPhone, but it is cut wrong. Period. Probably an awesome product if it fits...
B000UZVX92	Didn't even use them, waste of 80 cents. They didn't fit my iphone4 and wasn't able to apply it to my phone without tons of air bubbles.
B000UZVX92	This is the only iPhone screen protector I have tried, but for the price, I'm very happy with it.  The sticker method used for applying works great.  I found it pretty easy to align and I put on without air bubbles.  I had one tiny one which I pushed out with a credit card.  When it's on, it is only noticable if you look at the edges.  Otherwise, it looks perfect and is very thin.  My only issue with it is, I just got it today and it's already got a pretty heavy scratch on it.  I lent my phone to a friend for a few hours, so I don't know exactly what they did to scratch it, so I don't know how easy it is to ruin these things.  Regardless, I'm going to order two more just to have as replacements.  Another reviewer also said that the protectors leave some adhesive residue when removed, which I did not have a problem with.EDIT: I bought another one and after about a month, I managed to put another blemish in it.  I think it may have been from a button on my pocket digging into it when I sat.  Either way, I'm replacing it again.  But again, for the price, I really don't mind.
B000UZVX92	The discription does not tell me that it fits the earlier model only. With the IPhone 4 out this product should have the disclaimer that it does not fit the IPhone 4.
B000UZVX92	I am pretty much a "type A" when it comes to smudge and oil, and build up on my iphone touch screen so this film cover does the trick in eliminating the need to constantly wipe them off. I love this product!
B000UZVX92	Horrible, not worth buying. Doesn't even stick to the screen properly. Too big. Nothing good to say.
B000UZVX92	The screen protector did not fit the 3GS screen. The cutouts were in the wrong place so I had to choose to either partially cover the speaker or the home button.
B000UZVX92	The protector is advertised as covering the whole phone but the actual protector only covers the touch screen area.  Had to get another screen protector that actually covered the whole phone.
B000UZVX92	It is a decent product, and of course the price is right, but if you don't get it right, you can't fix it.  That was the situation for me and I ended up having to throw it away and am without a protector currently (because I removed my old one to place this one and the apple store no longer sells it for the older iphone).
B000UZVX92	I suggest that you please do not buy this screen protector. It is of no use. The sheet is no thicker than a grocery bag and it was dirty and damaged. I bought 2 sets and both of them are of no use to me. I just thrashed it.
B000UZVX92	Nothing great, but for the price you can't beat it. It is perfect if you are only looking to protect the face, without having bubbles. It does not in any way enhance or focus the images and icons on the screen as some protectors do. But like I said, great price and value.
B000UZVX92	very hard to put on the screen. tried to do everything but was unable to get rid of the bubbles on the screen. not recommended.
B000UZVX92	I was able to apply the screen protector with ease, but the red sticker left a whole white mark on screen. It took me around 15 minutes to soak it up with wet cloth and remove, though it still has the white left over of the red sticker.The quality of yellow cloth which comes with it is OK, not so good. I have to blow up the remains left by the cloth when I tried to clean the screen with it before applying the screen protector
B000UZVX92	The product says it is made for the 1st gen Iphone, but it is still a little to big. You can try all day to get it aligned perfectly but will be impossible. The length is correct, but the width is a little to long, creating air bubbles on one of the sides. I also thought this came with 3... But only received one. You pretty much get one shot at this. If you happen to bend one of the edges, it will look terrible, and becomes pretty worthless.
B000UZVX92	Fell off , put the next 1 on , fell off 1 day later. Really bad product, would not use again
B000UZVX92	The older reviews seem to regard these screen protectors as a decent product but the new ones they seem to be sending out are absolutely horrible. You get three pieces of flimsy plastic and when applied there are hundreds of little bubbles that are impossible to push out. Wiping it down gently with a microfiber cloth causes dozens of light scratch marks that can easily be seen. Horrible quality, horrible product. DO NOT BUY.
B000UZVX92	the screen itself wasn't so bad (though the bubbles are weird looking) but the main thing is the sticker doesn't come off smoothly. It leaves a sticky remainder that's impossible to get off.
B000UZVX92	I have to say that I'm quite disappointed with this product. It fits the product well but, on each side of the screen cover was a handle tag so that I wouldn't touch the sticky part of the cover. At first I thought this was a novel idea but when I went to remove the tag it didn't remover easily but it was difficult to remove and left sticker residue on the top of the screen cover. Now there is a spot in the lower right of the phone that picks up lint and makes it difficult to text or write. Other than this issue, the product is good. Cover's the screen well and doesn't residue the screen's brightness or qualit but, the fact that this reside remains is really unacceptable as far as a product goes.Thank you for your time,Wes
B000UZVX92	the intall was very clean, bubble free.  once installed can hardly tell that there is a protector on.
B00178YJME	The first time I applied this screen protector to my phone per the instructions, I noticed a few very small bubbles and dust particles that could not be removed.  I simply got used to them.  I had to remove and reattach the protector to a new phone and this added additional bubbles and dust particles.  Now its marginally okay to work with.  I recommend installing these protectors in a clean room as they are very susceptible to attacting dust that cannot be easily removed.  Otherwise, the anti-glare feature works well and it protects the screen as intended.
B001NTZ9JY	This is a great purchase. Did exactly what I needed it to do for a much more affordable price!
B001NTZ9JY	I started out with some fancy screen protectors for my storm. After having a lot of troubles with them I bought this 3 pack. They installed very easily and came with everything needed to install it bubble free. I've had it on my phone for several months now with no problems at all. The protector is not hard to clean and doesnt need frequent cleaning. Overall very satisfied with it.
B001NTZ9JY	Good screen protector, and cheap.  One caution: your glass screen must be ABSOLUTLEY immaculate before installing these clear membranes- the slightest dust particle will look like a boulder if trapped under the film.  I was concerned that a film like this would dull the vivid colors on the BB display, but you will never notice any difference.  This film can be cleaned with the same lens cleaner sprays, etc, other reviewers have mentioned.
B001NTZ9JY	this is not made for a storm 9530 it is made for 9500 thunder. i had to cut it down to size to make it fit. but they will work if you do this. still cheaper than the cell store.
B001NTZ9JY	Have used these for 3 years now and find them to inexpensively and effectively do exactly what they're supposed to.They are easy to apply, keep my wife's phone from harm inside her purse, and are a fraction of the cost you'll pay for the same thing thru your phone provider.Highly recommended!
B001NTZ9JY	The little tabs that help you remove the protective surfaces were apparently cemented on and wouldn't come off once applied.  Not real helpful to have a screen protector with a sticker covering a portion of the screen.
B001NTZ9JY	Amazing price, shipping was fast, and it's a very good quality screen protector..easy enough to apply.  Not much else to say!
B003ZMBSEM	I did not understand the extent of putting on a screen protector. This screen protector was not very hard to install and looks very good. No air bubbles or wrinkles.
B003ZMBSEM	I like to keep a screen protector on my phone and take care of it. I purchased this item after reading reviews and everything. However, when I received it, the screen protector was very hard to place on the screen and also very thick. It didn't affect the visual clarity when the screen was lit but was very visible when the screen went dark. I've already taken it off and am looking into other options that aren't as thick and difficult to apply.
B003ZMBSEM	I bought this product and the Stealth Shield screen protectors in the same order.  Identical products from the same company with different product names and prices.  For nearly the same price you get one Xtreme guard compared to two Stealth Shields.  Both work very well if you follow the insructions precisely.  Very happy.
B003ZMBSEM	The instructions are very clear.  On my first attempt, I was able to place the protector almost perfectly.  When this one wears out, I am certain my next placement will be perfect.I did not experience bubbles or distortions after installation.  Protector was very clear after the installation.Care must be take as the protector is softer than glass and can me marred.  It does not impact functionality, but does impact slightly the view of the screen.  (I did not have a good holster and placed the device in my pocket for the first week.)Will buy again.
B003ZMBSEM	I received this screen and it is excellent. It covers my phone without a problem. Is easy to attach, and is durable. It also provides a clear view without glare. Cut off small piece that covers speaker to hear calls without a problem.
B003ZMBSEM	While the packaging was not what I expected, it does what it is supposed to. I did not use water on my cell phone (duh!) as per the enclosed instructions. It holds just fine without it. Perfect fit for the torch.
B003ZMBSEM	This product works and fits the blackberry torch perfectly!!! Extremely easy to install. Be sure to follow the directions precisely for best results.
B003ZMBSEM	Screen protectors are pretty much the same, this one impressed me as I did not struggle to place it right, it was easy. Just a note for users: the first time you place it it will look bad as if with grains and lowering the quality of picture, but after 24 hours or so the screen protector attaches very well and becomes totally transparent that it will seem as if you had no protector! so dont be disapointed with the first impression, give it 24 hours to settle in.Additional information: I accidentally dropped by Torch and the screen hit directly an edge. Thanks to to this protector that was thick enough, even though the protector was ripped, nothing happened to the screen! I do not know what would have happened with the other screen protectors that are thin. Thanks god I had this protector!
B003ZMBSEM	I paid ~$20.00 for one of these screen protectors from best buy, but I had to return my BB torch for other reasons.  When I got the new phone in I wasn't going to shell out another 20, this one works just as good.  Following the instructions, I used liquid dish soap in water, shut the device, cleaned work area, phone, and HANDS good, dipped the whole screen protector in the water/soap mix then peeled the screen off the backing while in the water.  This minimizes fingerprints or debree and applies easily then squeege the water out while dabbing the edges with a cloth to soak the residue before they get into the phone.
B003ZMBSEM	Was a little leery about it due to the price..but when I got it in...it went on easy...and the sensitivity of the touch screen wasn't compromised.  All I can say is pay attention to you mail after you order.  It really looks like JUNK MAIL...i almost threw mine away.
B003ZMBSEM	I went through several BlackBerry Torch 9800 devices in the period of a couple of months, so I have actually used 3 of these protectors.  In general, they perform well.  I don't have any issues with the screen protector once it has been applied and dried.  My issue is with the application.  I am used to working with theSkinomi TechSkin - Screen Protector Shield for BlackBerry Torch 9800 + Lifetime Warrantyand while I thought this one would be the same in application, it's just not.  If you can position it properly on the first shot and have an absolutely lint-free, dust-free application environment, then you'll be fine.  However, I am extremely picky about the placement and positioning of a screen protector.  I thought that this would apply like the Skinomi with the soapy water allowing you to slide the protector around the screen a good bit until you have it just where you want it.  Not really.  I found that this protector stays a bit sticky, even with the soapy water, so I repeatedly had to pull it up off the screen and place it back down to get it just right.  As a result, I have spots where a tiny piece of dust got trapped between the screen and the protector during application.  There are several spots and it looks horrible and annoys me to no end.  I decided to pay extra for the Skinomi and will stick with that product in the future.Bottom line: If you can apply this protector in one shot with no dust trapped underneath, you'll love it.  If you're a perfectionist like me, pay the extra money and go with the Skinomi.
B003ZMBSEM	This screen protector works well for the BlackBerry Torch. The directions are long but not that complicated once you read them through. It took about 3 minutes to install and is working just fine. It was easy to position, fits perfectly, and did not weaken the touch screen responsiveness of my Torch. The protector is clear and doesn't add a lot of glare.My only complaint is that even when you follow the directions, it is almost impossible not to get finger prints on the underside of the screen protector. Once the plastic is applied, you cannot get them off. Fortunately, once my phone is turned on, I cannot see the finger prints.Overall, given the fact that the screen protector was so inexpensive and works as advertised, I'm a happy camper.
B003ZMBSEM	Damage is very fast, and I do not meet my expectations as a product, but that does not mean it is not good, because I think about what I valued, but I love shopping at Amazon
B003ZMBSEM	I installed this protector yesterday - it's very similar to all the other protectors I've used.  It was easy to install with the very detailed instructions included.  It fits the 9800 Torch perfectly.
B003ZMBSEM	This product works well, adheres well and I had no bubbles. The glitch is that I have a rainbow vertical streak on the right hand side even after a month of application (I have gotten used to it, but definitely a bummer). Also since the material is a rubber based film, there are "bumps" on the screen after you apply it. See it at an angle under bright light and you will know what I mean. Of course, not to take away for the fact that at $2 it does a job far better than many of the $14-$20 counterparts and is exceptionally easy to install, without any bubbles and so close that you will not even know there is a screen guard.If only I can get that rainbow streak out.
B003ZMBSEM	As has been said, application is easy if you follow the instructions exactly.  Make sure the water is cold, and be generous with the dish soap.  Completely soak the back of the guard and slide on to avoid bubbles.  If you've ever installed tint on windows or played around with window clings, the process should be simple for you.As for actual product review, the included squeegee works nicely.  Any distortions/the rainbow effect from the water/soap mixture cleared up within 8 hours. The guard has not affected touch sensitivity or clarity, and it cleans up nicely with any microfiber cloth.
B003ZMBSEM	I order this screen protector for my BlackBerry Torch and it never arrived.  I emailed the seller and was told I have the option of getting a refund or having the seller send me another item.  I asked the seller to resend me my item.  When I received my item, it was not what I had originally ordered.
B003ZMBSEM	Absolutely awesome for the price you can't even tell that there is a screen protector.easy to install, fast deliver and great price
B003ZMBSEM	Pros: Fast shipping, quality and packaging.Cons: Difficulty of installation.This cover was shipped in two days. When I first recieved the screen protector I was anxious to put one on, I orded four of them so I would have extras in case I made a mistake and so I could have spair cases for the next two years. The initial quality seems high. The protectors are packaged with one appilicator card and micro-fiber cloth per protector. When putting on this protector it is very important you read everysingle direction.  You begin by washing the phone screen with soapy water, then your hands. You coat your fingers with soapy water and remove the screen protector from its backing. You then lightly wet the back of the protector and place on the screen. Now you can move it into place before it begins to get sticky again. Using the included squeegy card, smooth out the protector, eliminating air bubbles and excess water. At this point the screen will look blurred, which made me nervious and slightly dissapointed. I then re-read the dirrections and it said that the blurriness will slowly go away over the next two days. So I was patient. The next morning the blurriness was only slightly visible and now 3 days later is completely gone.  As for the quality, this cover would definetly protect from minor scraps and cuts but however XXXXXXXXXXTttttttrrrrreeeeeemeeee it is is still in quetion.This product takes a long time to install and cure, but it seems to adhere to the phone very well. It is not as extreme "military grade" as a lot of these protectors claim to be, but I think it will do the job. On top of which the functionality and feel of my touch screen was not effected at all.
B003ZMBSEM	I loved it, and it was not hard to apply to my phone. The only problem I had is that the screen protector is too small length-wise for the screen. There is a little space between the physical keys and the touchscreen that is not covered.
B003ZMBSEM	Excellent screen guard. It's a perfect fit for my Torch. Didn't have a problem with application. Air bubbles were gone after a few days.
B003ZMBSEM	I experienced troubles applying the product without it taking away from the functionality of the phone. I got it to work, however I eventually used the phone without it.
B003ZMBSEM	I had bought two the first time and they worked really well! I then bought three more just incase I have to change them again. I got it right first try. definitely coming back to buy more when i need them.
B003ZMBSEM	good: fits perfectly the torch 9810, crystal clear, touch screen sensitivity is perfect and the installation is not complicated but requires some patience.bad:  the cover is surprisingly soft. I have a similar protection on my digital camera (touch screen as well) and it is much harder and insensitive to nail scratch. After one day of use I already had 2 visible scratches and I do not believe this will last me 1-2 years as advertised.Note, the first 2 days the screen caused some optical iridescence (rainbow effect), it disappeared once fully dried, now it is crystal clear.In short the perfect fitting and clarity are key for me, so I still give it 4 stars.
B003ZMBSEM	I put this on my Torch soon after I got the phone and never had to take it off. It really feels good solid protector and also very smooth. There was no change in touch sensitivity; atleast I didn't fee it. Definitely worth having it; keeps your screen scratch free. Recommended for Torch owners.
B003ZMBSEM	The best screen guard money can buy, even at this cheap price. Once placed on correctly the screen guard is not felt nor seen and will last as long as you have the phone. It is even removable to place on another screen but not as nice as the first time.
B003ZMBSEM	Easy to install. Just follow the instructions that came with the product. Started out with a few bubbles, but after a few days they disappeared. Did not really affect the touch sensitivity of the screen.Overall can't go wrong for $2
B0048ATB8U	This is a HORRIBLE screen protector. It does not cover the whole screen and it is very thick. Now I will have to spend for money for a better one. I guess that is what I get for being cheap.
B0048ATB8U	I can't even tell it's there, but the screen works perfectly to my touch. Bought a 3-pack, but haven't needed but one even though I am really rough on my phone.
B0053AU6Q0	got the item in the mail.Did not come in a klearkare box or with any of the items shown on their "installation video".2nd plastic is very difficult to remove so got the film upside down.  Since fingers are wet you really dont realize this till you try to clean it, and then it is too late since all the fibers from cleaning cloth get on it.will not buy again.
B005AV7U8Y	This is a pretty cool idea, I love it. My nephews and nieces love this too and they enjoy making silly faces at themselves. The only thing is, in the sun...I can't see a darn thing :( Kinda wish I knew that, but hey, it can't be prefect! I still love this and will order more whenever I need a new one.P.S. When I first applied it, some reason there's a bunch of lines across the top. I can't see it unless I have it at a certain angle, so it doesn't really bother me...but yea. Just an fyi.
B005AV7U8Y	this item is good fit for daily use and works perfectly on my xperia play. highly recommended for this screen protector
B006JHU4TA	Clear. Very nice fit  This is well work the money.  I would not recommend another product.  Excellent over all.  No issues.
B006JHU4TA	Would not stick to my screen. Tried cleaning it making sure it was good and dry but still wouldn't stick.
B006JHU4TA	Works great. There isn't 18 words worth to say about this product and I find this to be silly ok.
B006JHU4TA	I do not like these screen protectors.  The finish it too shiny, it makes the phone screen very hard to see in bright light.  Also,  they scratch much more easily than the protectors I had before (Empire Screen Defender).  Finally, they are NOT reusable! Once you remove them, if you try to put them back on they do not adhere to the screen properly.  There are large air bubbles and white spots if you try to reuse them.
B006JHU4TA	The screen protectors are just as good as Verizon ones. It was really easy for me to apply and had no bubble issues. The plastic used feels sturdy and screen quality isn't ruined with it on. Great cheap purchase and arrived quickly.
B006JHU4TA	These are compatible with the sensor on the phone that tells it when the phone is held up to your face. No need to cut out the little notch. They go on easily with no more bubbles than the average screen protector. Unfortunately, the protector does scratch easily (and shows these scratches), but much better a cheap screen protector than your phone. I would buy these again if I run out.
B006JHU4TA	These really interfere with the light sensor near the Verizon logo, which is a shame because in every other aspect they're great.  The screen lights up for a split second when I take the phone away from my face, but as soon as I try to hit a button it goes black and no amount of pressing the power button or shaking the phone will keep it lit up (navigating automated menus are the stuff nightmares are made of).  A Verizon tech told me that he'd had a lot of complaints about this and suggested taking the protector off.  Lo and behold, I took it off for a day and had no issues using my screen while on calls.  Unfortunately, I'd recommend different protectors than these ones.
B006JHU4TA	easy to install and works as they are supposed to.  I am happy with my purchase and would buy again if needed.
B006JHU4TA	i love them. they fit just right without any problems or air bubbles. i got my mom some for a different place but it just wasnt as clear and there we tons of air bubble. i will be sure to get it from you again.
