B00024OKGO	If you can fit the ear buds in your ears, the sound is good.  The anti-tangle is a feature every phone cord should come with.I think most people actually use this headphone incorrectly. If used correctly, the mic comes up on your chest. I believe, oddly, that you connect the clasp on the cord together around your head - like a necklace.When you do that, the earbuds - now secure in their little square rings hang untagled on your chest and the mic is half way up your chest.In this configuration, the whole thing is secure, untangled and eminently workable.Everything good, except my little button doesn't appear to work and so I don't get all the good press to answer, hang-up or voice command stuff I would like.
B00024OKGO	These little earbuds offer surprisingly good music reproduction! I tried the Nokia HDB-4 boom set for awhile but wanted stereo and better bass. The HS-3 delivered both and in an easy to manage configuration.You can't really see it in the pictures- the wires are enclosed in a clear nylon mesh which resembles the braided wrap inside shielded audio cables. This outer wrap helps make the HS-3 wires much less prone to tangling up and affords some strain-relief all the way down to the pop-port connector.There are also a pair of sliding square rings which will slip down to the earbuds when you have them out of your ears- and these keep the buds snug against the little controller/microphone switch; another effective anti-tangle touch that adds to the ease of use and storage of these clever little headphones.Although I don't like a microphone to be way down on my sternum for phone calls, the addition of the mic does allow for a fast answer of incoming calls and the option to then unplug the headphones to carry on your conversation using the phone itself.When you are using the phone in the radio mode, the answer switch also serves as a radio station frequency changer; each press of the answer switch selects the next station in the phone's memory- a handy extra for radio surfing.I sure wish I'd bought my HS-3's here- the Amazon price is quite a bit less than it is on the Nokia website!
B00024OKGO	I am one of the people that reviewer below advised steer clear from this headset. Only, the thing is, I dont have particularly small ears. Hence, Im afraid most of the people will find this set pretty  aggravating as you have to really press the earpieces in to set them in your earlobe. 30 minutes later your ears will be pretty sore. Also, the sounds quality isn't really that great either, especially the bass. On the good side, the anti-tanging system can shave off valuable seconds when disentangling the cord, which depsite the anti-friction coating, still occurs.
B00024OKGO	I purchased this headset for 6230 because it provides stereo sound and plus the connector to the phone won't block the charger port.  When using this headset you actually get higher volumn than using the handset, it gets pretty loud if you crank it all the way up.I usually get only 1 bar of signal where I work and the calls are always breaking up, but one day I found out if I have the headset plugged in I can actually hear very clearly with still 1 bar of signal, somehow it helped the reception although the user manual of 6230 says the wire is only acting as FM antenna.
B00024OKGO	This thing is weird, but if you can get over that then it's pretty cool.  First off, ear buds are huge.  If you have small ears then it won't be comfortable for you.  Second, the cord is really long which is both useful and annoying.  Third, the wires are wrapped in a plastic weave so they are far stiffer than regular headset wire (but very well protected if you're in to that.)  Fourth, the microphone sits around the level of your waist.  It's a miracle that anyone can hear you, but somehow Nokia figured it out (although supposedly it sounds like speakerphone with some echo.)  If you can get over all that then it's an awesome accessory.  The phone interruption feature with the push-button answer is sweet and the radio works well enough.
B000M93P6A	I love these Creative headphones.  I got them promptly and feel I paid a fair price
B000M93P6A	I gifted this headset to my sister, she liked it very much. She says it is comfortable and easy to use and the sound quality is great. So my word is go for it, a good investment and a worth for the money.
B000M93P6A	I use this headset for skype and to listen to music from my laptop.  It's comfortable, only minor irritation when used for extended periods.  The microphone is removable and can be positioned on either side.  Just don't lose it when it's disconnected.  The noise cancelling works great.  First I bought a Logitech travel model that came with a carrying case.  The noise cancelling in that hardly worked.  This headset is much better and the price was almost $25 cheaper.  Definatly worth a look at.
B000M93P6A	I works well, good sound quality and the microphone also works very well.Problem: It hurt ears if you wear it more than 20min or so.
B000M93P6A	TheCreative Headset HS-400is a quality set that includes stereo headphones combined with a nice adjustable microphone. Whether you're using it for gaming, chatting, teleconferencing or internet phone applications, this unit is well worth a look.The set is nicely designed for those that like the behind the head style of headset. The headphones won't sit as firmly on your head, but they will leave your hair untouched.The ear pads are made from soft foam and are very comfortable to use over a long time period. The bass and mid-range tones are decent for this type of headset, especially in this price range.The Microphone arm is also easily moved from the left side to the right side based on your preference. There is also volume control with a microphone mute switch, for those multi-taskers out there. :)Creative says that it is "a noise cancelling microphone." I have no complaints about the microphone, but the HS-600's microphone seems a little bit better. That could just be because of the adjustable head on the other model.The bottom line is, if you prefer the behind-the head style and the headphones are more important than the microphone, than the HS-400 is for you. Otherwise, look into theCreative HS-600 Headset with Microphonefor a more stable fit and a microphone with a nice adjustable head.Other entry level headsets in the $30 and below price range include theCyber Acoustics AC-101 Monaural Headset & Boom Micand theCyber Acoustics AC-201 Stereo Headset with microphone, both of which went back to where I got them from after testing.  You may also want to look into theLogitech Premium Stereo Headset with Noise-Canceling Microphoneor another alternative.  As for me, I'm sticking with Creatives, though like I said I still prefer the HS-600s.If you don't mind the wired connection, this set is worth a look.Enjoy!
B000M93P6A	I was looking for a decent noise cancelling headphones, but there are expensive; then I found it, a nice and cheap headphone I could use everywhere, even in the noisy NY subway, and still I have a good and clear sound, specially when I need to listen my College lectures from my voice recorder.I definitely recommend this product.
B000M93P6A	The best thing about this headset is the noise cancelling function.Although it doesnt cancell all noise surround me, it reduce the noise a lot.It's quite helpful when I want to read book and listen to musics without any loud noise!!!
B003WV391Q	I am not sure how these sound, but when I am strangling a farm-raised ostrich for a gourmet meal, only the FINEST tools will suffice.  Needless to say, the headphone wire on these is great for ostriches and it probably works on cassowarys, too.
B003WV391Q	I bought these to use with my iPhone - primarily while studying for school.  The sound quality is amazing and I've had a few premium headphones over the years.  The bass is rich, the treble bright but not overwhelming.  While the price is pretty high, they do live up to the promise.  I'm very pleased with my purchase!
B003WV391Q	Wow these sound amazing. I am 48 years old and was listening to music I have owned since high school with these headphones today and heard things I've never heard before. Used them on my IPhone4, ITouch and my classic 160gb and they sound wonderful on all devices. They are so clean and clear. I have owned high end Klpsch, Shure, Koss, Sony, Beats and Bose and these are by far the best. The Bass is tuneable to your liking. They come with a ton of tips to pick from so they are a great fit. my musical taste is all over the place...from Bach and Motzart to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Steely Dan to industrial, goth and rap and everything in between and they all sound better with these headphones. I also used them on my high end surround sound system and movies never sounded better. I think that I have found the keeper. No more searching, buying and selling of headphones for me. The best headphones on the market hands down.ps.i have 19,762 songs on my ipod
B003WV391Q	My ie8 broken 2 weeks ago, and after long search i finally buy ie 8i as part of semi sidegrade.compare to normal ie8 this 8i have much weaker base, if i'm not buy directly from amazon i would think it was fake, on top of it the adjustable base on iem itself doesn't seems working. with my old ie8 there big difference between lowest and highest base setting on headphone itself, it make no difference in 8i model.i just got this few days and only burn in for 30+ hours.. i will give another 70 hour burn in and hope the base open up. otherwise i think i would return this and get westone UM3x.
B003WV391Q	These sound great, however the fit is painful no matter how I rotate them. I can tolerate them for an hour or two, but that is about it. Really too bad, because I love the way these perform acoustically.
B003WV391Q	great sound, comfortable and defiantly worth the money. bought it as a replacement for a lower model and it out preforms them in every way.
B003WV391Q	Not an audiophile by any means but I LOVE MY MUSIC!  I listen to various genres of music but predominantly HIP HOP, Rap, R&B;, Dub Step and selected pop music like Jessie J for instance. I own a set of Beats by Dre Studio headphones which I used as my main phones of choice in most environments, including just walking around, watching DVDs and even in the gym. For my style of music, they were almost perfect and delivered awesome, controlled bass and clear mids and highs. I almost went for a set of Denon AHD 5000 but plumbed for the Beats after much soul searching!They have been awesome and I have had no gripes other than the fact that the cables have both frayed at the point here they attach to the buds. This is due more to my use. Than any inherent flawes so I take full responsibility!  I decided to get replacement cables but to stop using them as my everyday set of phones and keep them for more sedate use. I therefore decided to in vest in a decent set of IEMs.I have owned various IE headphones it he past of varying quality. The problem I have had with all of them is the fact that the fit is never exactly right and. They are always a struggle to keep in - I have small ears!! Another, more serious problem is that they almost all ended up faulty with the sound from one side beckoning intermittent then stoping altogether!!Having got used to the quality of the Beats, I couldn't settle on anything other than a comparable set of IEMs. After much research and reading and comparing loads of reviews, I ordered a set of Monster Turbines. I decided early on to invest in a set of custom in ear moulds to put to bed the problems I have always had with fitment and also to finally get the best ini noise isolation and sound reproduction! After checking the ASC website, I discovered they did not do custom moulds for the Turbines. After looking through their current list and again comparing models, I chose the Sennheiser IE8s and ordered them from Amazon. When they arrives, I discovered they were in fact IE8is!!! The inclusion of the remote was an unexpected bonus!I've read a lot about the 'burn in' period required to get the best out these phones. If that is the case , I can't wait because out of the box they sound AWESOME! Back to back comparisons with the Beats Studio puts them head and shoulders above the Studios! The overall quality of sound is cleaner and the base more than holds it's own without being over powering. It seems more controlled and delivers a tighter punch while still delivering mids and highs that come through beautifully. Granted, fitment is still a bit hit and miss but when I attach the included over ear accessory, the buds stay firmly in place even if not fully 'locked' in ear. This is not a big problem as I always intended to have. The custom moulds made - the impression of which I had made yesterday!!!To get an idea of what they WILL sound like, I simply cup my hands over my ears and press the buds firmly into my ear canals and they are transformed to an even higher plane of excellence!!  The overall price (200.00 for IE8s + 100.00 for moulds inc P&P;) brings the overall quality to a level of IEM costing almost twice as much, if not more. Even then, at that price, investment in custom moulds would be almost mandatory, raising the cost even higher.When I get the moulds, I will write a more detailed review as, by then, they would have had a chance to burn in more!!
B003WV391Q	I've bought 4 different brands/models  over 100 USD inEar headphones to test.Sennheiser IE 8i had the best sound.Though I didn't keep it since I like to switch songs often in the middle and listen to a next one. Sennheiser's remote was INCONVENIENT in this model: too small buttons and the sensitivity also bad (need to press too hard, sometimes it skipped 2 songs).Go for it if you listen your music without switching the tracks often!P.S. By the way I didn't like to wear them with a cord over the ear. I wanted to have a simple plug-in headphones.So I switched left and right headphones (they are detachable in this IE 8i Sennheiser) to preserve the 'order' and have been using them as most usual inEar headphones. With premium sound quality.
B003WV391Q	The package is old ,but the earphone is OK,I love it! Thank you for your good service! I will choose your store again!
B003WV391Q	I tried it on the macbook and the sound was cinema like. It's so crisp, it takes time to get used to. When using other in-ear you notice the difference immediately. I would recommend using it on less than a laptop without an amp. Great product! a legend!
B003WV391Q	This is a very good headphones, very comfortable to wear, and it is suitable for listening to classical musics. And the transport is quick.
B003WV391Q	Package|AccessoriesThe IE8 comes in an attractive, sturdy package that consists of many accessories. They include cable guides, shirt clip, cleaning tool/bass knob key, 10 sets of eartips, and a protective case. The protective case is pretty bulky for travel but it's pretty, lined with brushed aluminum.Fit|Isolation|AppearanceThe IE8 fits snug and very well in the ear. It's very comfortable, even when worn to sleep. The isolation with the included eartips however, is not that great. It depends on the ear but I found the Monster foam Supertips to work very well for isolation. The design is pretty simple, nothing too fancy. The housing has the Sennheiser logo and the adjustable bass knob is visible.Build|CableThe build quality of the IE8 is outstanding. It's housing is made with durable plastic and looks as though could take a beating. The only possible downside is the nozzle, which could come off if twisted too forcefully when putting in certain eartips like Comply. The cable is one of the better ones out there, not to mention it's replaceable. It's Kevlar-reinforced and tangle-resistant with proper strain reliefs on the plug/y-split. The plug is angled but surprisingly, not gold plated. The mic/remote works like it's supposed to.SoundThe IE8 sounds amazing to my ears. The treble is just right, very clear and detailed. The midrange is smooth, really brings the vocals out. The bass is very strong, not muddy but clear and monstrous. It has a bass adjustment knob to please any basshead. Soundstage on this is unreal, the music sounds like it's coming from everywhere. If you're a hip hop music fan, this is a must have. Only thing I noticed when listening to genres other then hip hop, some sounds get overemphasized and makes it seem unnatural. It seems like this was made for listening to hip hop.The VerdictAlthough there are earphones that are more detailed, there is none with the combination of the bass and soundstage of the IE8. I'm in a happy place every time I listen hip hop with these bad boys. These can be had for under $300 and is worth every penny due to the build, replaceable cable, comfort, and sound.
B00788VXJY	Just a little feedback.The sound is so good, but it lacks on design, the cable is so thin and i guess it could break easily, the only thing is to wear it carefully always.Regards.
B00788VXJY	I loved these headphones! they are definitely one of the finest pairs I've owned. I'm no professional to sound quality or an expert reviewer, but I sure do love these as a casual user. these headphones are very strong in many areas, and while the bass is sometimes not punchy enough and the main audio is a bit swallowed by the ambiance, it's definitely a terrific sounding pair of headphones. my only major gripe is that the little switch on the side controlling audio levels is cheap and plastic, while the rest is pure metal. it is also not laid out very well either, kinda confusing to use when you're not looking at it. one last note, there is a bit of static noise in the background of low volume music, possibly just my pair but be wary if you don't listen to very loud music.overall, these are fantastic, and sound like 80+ dollar headphones. if you can find it cheaper than 45, then you'll definitely get your money's worth, but 45 dollars is still reasonable.
B00788VXJY	These are the best sounding ear buds I have owned, granted I am rather thrifty and not willing to spend a great deal of money.When seated properly in the ear bass is tight and quick, not booming, mids are sweet and the highs are crisp without being sharp.
B00788VXJY	good bass good sound what more can you want from your headphones.doesnt fall out of your ears and the wires dont get tangled so its all highly recommend
B00788VXJY	I had these headphones for several months and the controls and sound were good for the price but other issues greatly reduces this rating. My first complaint is you hear noise from the wires as they move around, especially when it's cold. I don't mean 5 degree cold but 32 degree cold. I wonder if these headphones were even tested in cold weather. My second complaint is one side quit working suddenly. I've never had a set of headphones that broke so quickly. I would not consider getting another pair. I went with Panasonic this time based on review and so far so good.
B00788VXJY	These have great sound and deep bass, but the right ear piece became nothing but static after less than three months.  I can find nothing about a warranty on them.  Shame, I really liked them.
B00788VXJY	Poor sound quality , not a sharp or clear sound.Additionally,  These look is cheap.The Picture is different to reality.
B00788VXJY	Has anyone used these with an android device? And did the mic and volume control still work for it ?
B00788VXJY	I had a hard time to give up with my half broken seenheiser headphones cause I loved them, but the E10M had revealed to be as good for a quite cheaper price. The only thing I regret is that the cable is symmetrical, while I prefer to have a longer cable for the right headphone so the cable can go around your neck and improve the stability of the ear tips.
B00788VXJY	Arrvied quickly.  Sound is fantastic.  Great bass.  Fullness to the sound that i've not had before from in-ear headphones.  wont be beat for price
B00788VXJY	I felt the sound quality of the headphones was excellent for about a week, then I started to hear some occasional static.  Still haven't figured out source - damaged earpiece? .  Almost immediately the seal near the plug-in came lose and I had to have it resealed by a friend that knows about such things.  When they work, they are high quality headphones, however, for the price, I would expect a higher quality build.  I still have my 3-year old IPhone ear plugs that work perfect and have no parts coming lose, etc.  They are much reduced sound quality, however, they never fell apart.
B00788VXJY	Been using this headset for almost 2 weeks now and I love them. The tips included cover a decent spread of different ears. The microphonics are there but does not bother me as much as the last headset I used (RHA 450i, they were really bad). Reviews about the controls being not good aren't far from the truth, the buttons are almost indistinguishable from each other when trying to raise volume or pressing the center button. Sound is full bodied and hits all the notes for me. I came across this headset after hitting up several audiophile sites and this set came up all the time for being one of the best sub-$50 headphones. A Y adapter is included to split up the earphones and microphone and use it on your computer or any device that supports it.If you're looking for big sound for not a big price, this is the set you want.
B00788VXJY	Really great sound quality!! I would definately roccommend, big step-up from my $10.00 ones, and to the guy that complained that the replacement warranty was not honored and gave a bad review due to that, what you are reading is the MANUFACTURER WARRANTY, Amazon has nothing to do with that unless it happened during the first month of ownership, the MANUFACTURER DOES honor the one year warranty, make sure you read more carefully next time and contact SoundMAGIC. Thanks for the awesome head phones!! :D
B00788VXJY	Let me start by saying I am a cheap person by nature so I do alot of research before I buy. Ive purchased over 10 different brands of earbuds and headphones through out my life, everything from skullcandy 50/50 to klipsch S4I so I have a pretty well rounded take of under 100 dollar earphones. Hopefully the following review will help you avoid any disapointment.SOUND  These earbuds are really well balanced when it comes to sound, The 10mm drivers produce a very warm and clear sound that covers the complete audio spectrum, clear highs, full mid range, and clean deep bass. No matter what genre of music you like these earbuds will sound good. I highly recommend a burn in period of around 40 hours, if you dont know how to burn in earbuds google it because it does make a difference in sound.FUNCTION  Soundmagic provides a wide variety of different size silicone ear tips which is alot more important then people think, if you do not have a perfect seal in you ear audio quality is noticeably diminished especially when it comes to bass. The volume control and mic work well, however the center button for skipping songs and pausing is a bad design because it is flush with the other buttons, so you might find yourself trying to change the song or pick up a call and instead accidentaly turning up the volume, so to fix this I cut a very small piece of electrical tape and put it on the center button making it easier to distinguish. The cord on the e10m gets tangled fairly easily compared to other brands I have purchased. The e10m also comes with a clip for your shirt which is very usefull to hold the mic in place for phone calls.BUILD QUALITY  At first glance this product looks and feels very well built, the earbud drivers are made of metal and have a robust solid feel without being too heavy, however the main reason why I gave this product 3 of 5 stars overall is the left earbud went out due to a loose connection in the cord. I have had this product for just under 5 months before they broke. I used these earbuds about 2 hours daily and took very good care of them so for me 50 dollars for 5 months of use or 10 dollars a month, is not a justified price.
B00788VXJY	If you are stuck with your iphone/ipod oem headphones, you are missing a world of music. This are by far the best headphones price/quality around. You 'll never go back to your apple ones again.
B00788VXJY	I got these headphones in the beggining of April and I was pretty happy about them, they were a step up from my $10 headphones from walmart and they came with a lot of different ear pieces. I read some reviews online about people saying the cable was flimsy and they might break within a year or so. I thought it wouldn't be that big of a deal since a lot of reviews didn't mention it. I was wrong. 3 months into having the headphones the right ear piece went out. I thought it wouldn't be that hard to get them replaced, the card it came with said it had a year warranty...nope...I contacted amazon about the broken headphones and they said they could give me 20% of the price I paid or nothing...not even switch it out...Don't buy these if you want headphones that last.
B00788VXJY	Right ear bud is no more working within 6 months of use, disappointed really. Returned them with help of Amazon customer service(who are awesome btw). Following is what I wrote in my first review on this product which I still believe is true in case of sound quality but really really disappointed with durability.First review:I have had Bose ies before this, after that broke apart in a year i was really confused about what to buy within $50/$60. I researched a lot and settled down with this soundmagic e10m. Never really heard of soundmagic before but ordered it anyway. I was blown away with the bass it generates, mids and highs are just fine. I compared it with Beats Studio Over-Ear Headphone($299) and surprisingly I found soundmagic bass to be much better than beats' however beats had better clarity. I am a bass lover, definitely more than happy with my buy.
B00788VXJY	Is the best in ear headphones I've ever used for the money I paid . The sound is clear. Love it.
B00788VXJY	I have tried a lot of headsets with mics and this seems to be the best combination of features, albeit a little expensive for what you get.PROS:1. 6 different sizes of rubber earbuds -- I have learned that getting the right fit is critical to the bass response;2. Earbuds fit tightly onto the headset -- this is important, because I almost always lose the rubber tips before the headphone dies or gets lost.  Although there are sellers of replacement tips, they rarely seem to fit the headset.  I have about five bags of ones I  have tried to use unsuccessfully on other headsets, like the Apple and MotoRckr;3. Warm lows, and clear highs without being tinny soundingCONS:There are three buttons on the right side cord: volume up, volume down, and pause --  pause is in the middle, and is the button I use all the time.  It is a small button, so it takes some fiddleing to hit it right in the middle.  I have big fingers, and imagine a person with smaller fingers would have more dexterity there.Price:  At 44.99 at the time I write this, it is a little expensive.  There are other headsets that cost $30 sound as good but are not available anymore, and I haven't found anything better recently.On balance, if you want an in-ear headset with a microphone that has pretty good sound and sound isolation, without a lot of cord noise (when the cord bumps against yuo when walking) then these are a good choice -- the best for me that I have found after trying about 5 other sets recently.
B00788VXJY	if you want excellent sound these are the buds to pick. Ive owned many earbuds from many excellent brand names, Sennhiezer, Sony, Klipsch and the list goes on. for the price these are better than any others I've owned,. Perfect sound balance, great base, miss and highs. buy them poi won't be sorry. I punched the E10M with the mic and iPhone control. Im thrilled.
B00788VXJY	Because at the first time I thought that was a Sennheiser earphone so I chose it. And when I had it, it's a bit uncomfortable for my ears, and one thing I couldn't play the next or previous song by physical buttons.
