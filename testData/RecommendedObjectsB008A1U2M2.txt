B000QU4DH0	I found the screen guard difficult to install, it was hard to get the air bubbles out and the slightest dust on the back made it impossible to install.  One trick to make it easier to install is to take clear packaging tape and use it to clean the face down side then to try putting it on again, it makes it easier to get rid of the air bubbles and any dust that got on it will be picked up by the tape.  One thing I don't like is that the finger prints and oil from your fingers stay on the screen guard even when you wipe it, it just smears it; it's hard to clean-clean the screen guard.
B000QU4DH0	This item does not appear to be of low quality but did turn out to be difficult to install. Cleaning my screen was easy but putting on the screen protector was slightly more tricky. If it isn't centered quite perfectly the corners will show air underneath and won't be very well attached. The small air bubbles are very hard to get out and the supplied air bubble remover tool seems nearly worthless. And also, don't buy one of these individually. Try to get one of these free with the purchase of a phone case. It isn't much more expensive.
B001F2T5RG	I got this little peace of plastic not even the right size or shape for my phone. i don't recommend anybody buying this product.
B001F2T5RG	It was easy to apply and it's been great ever since.  I've had it on for almost 6 months and you can't even tell it's there.
B001F2T5RG	This screen protector was easy to apply and the Bold screen is still crystal clear. Make sure you wash your hands and clean whatever surface you will be working on as once you remove the original Bold screen protector, the screen becomes a dust magnet!  The included dust cloth works very well to remove all of the dust from the Bold screen beforehand as the protector magnifies everything underneath it. Make sure you only remove the tab #1 side until you finish applying the protector.  The cardboard package works well to push any air bubbles to the edges.This product must be from a different manufacturer than the others where buyers have been unhappy as this screen protector is easy to apply, effective and certainly worth the $0.1 cost [plus the shipping].
B001F2T5RG	Not worth it as it is difficult to place it because it wont stay on. Maybe because I have the older version but really not worth it!
B001F2T5RG	Easy to install. It did hide some of the minor scratches on my screen. It has been about 4 weeks since I bought these and so far it has worked out good.The order came on time and in excellent condition, with complete instructions.Con -  The name suggests it is reusable. Not sure what is the "reusable" aspect in it.
B001F2T5RG	I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT!!!!!!  STILL IT'S BEEN SOOOO LONG AND YET NO REFUND DESPITE ASKING FOR ONE! IT'S SOOO CHEAP I DON'T CARE FOR ONE BUT I WON'T ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS PLACE.
B001F2T5RG	This product works well and if you do buy,buy 2 so if you screw one up. They go on very well and I have had no problems, air bubbles ect . Great product!!
B001F2T5RG	Buy 2 of this and when you see how careful you have to be during the installation process, you will have the second one for you to succeed. The ones that say "it leaves a white strip on it" is because they didn't see that this protector comes with TWO protections on both sides, you must peel both sides to reveal the real protector. If installed carefully, slowly and in a dust free environment it works perfectly fine. I'm rating it 3 starts because it comes in a .42 envelope and they charge you 2.98 for shipping, I don't like to be fooled like that.
B001F2T5RG	I bought this to install on my new unopened bold. I installed it the instant I pulled the protective plastic off the screen that it shipped with. I'm not sure I'd pay the money to do it again. You pay $3 to ship this item that arrives with a .42 cent stamp. Unless you place it perfectly the 1st time, it just won't look great. You have to kind of curl it and lay it down gradually or you'll have bubbles and not much fun getting them out. You also have to have it aligned perfectly or the edges will be lifted up by the frame of the phone screen. Again, if you have to pick it back up to reapply, you've lost it. I think if someone had practice with these things, they could get satisfactory results, but I'm not sure someone trying it for the first time will have much luck.dsI'd skip it.
B001F2T5RG	Excellent screen protectors. Very durable and long lasting. A must for any cell phone, Ipad or any portable screen device that is prone to scratches etc.
B001F2T5RG	The products fits perfectly and comes with more than I expected. It also came with a cleaning cloth. GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001F2T5RG	THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE. HOWEVER, I ONLY WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE WORKED WITH VERIZON. SO I HAD TO RETURN IT.
B001F2T5RG	Excelente vendedor lo recomiendo, fue super rapida la transaccion y el vendedor atento a es!! A su vez el envio llego rapido a la direccion expuesta!!
B001F2T5RG	The bottom 10% of the touch screen is not covered by this screen.  It does not fit the Bold 9000 touch screen.  I guess that's what you get for $0.69.
B001F2T5RG	good value on this product and easy to apply. This is a perfect fit for BB 9000 phone would recommend
B001F2T5RG	The screen protector tab left paper marked on the screen protector. The screen protector would not say compressed to my phone screen.
B001F2T5RG	I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid for this screen protector, however I was pleasantly surprised.The screen protector is cut to cover the entire area of my Blackberry Bold screen, and it has a nice cutout for the earpiece.Fit is pretty good and quality is above average. This protector feels like it will last a long time.
B001F2T5RG	The screen protector was very inexpensive to buy and seems to be doing the job.  However, it seems impossible to avoid trapping air bubbles at the edges of the screen.  The screen itself curves up at the edges and the screen protector is flat.  Consequently, the protector wants to pull away from the screen at the bottom of the curved surface.  It does not sem to affect visibility when the screen is illuminated, but the air pockets are visible when the screen is dark.
B001F2T5RG	This is a great idea in theory.  However, the instructions for applying the protector are insufficient (i.e., non-existent) so I wasted one just figuring it out.  Once it was on, there were air pockets that I cannot remove and cannot be smoothed out.  For my fellow type A personalities, it is annoying long-term.  In short, for the amount of "protection" it provides, not worth the shipping cost (which is more than the product).  I won't be buying more.
B001F2T5RG	This screen protector does exactly what it was designed for.  It was easy to apply to the face of the Blackberry Bold and was a precise fit.  Well done.
B001F2T5RG	I bought this on August 12th and did not receive it, filed a claim, got a response that they would re-send it to me but to the day, Sept 24th, nothing.... I bought a second screen saver, from the same provider on Sept 8th and still did not receive it. The worst thing is that you cannot track these items, this is very frustrating.
B001F2T5RG	Obviously when you buy a screen protector you expect to have it clear... I got it with a code bar sticker just right on it and left a white sticky glue when I peeled it off! So, sadly could not use it...
B001F2T5RG	All three failed.  The worst part of these, the paper was permanently vulcanized to the part of the plastic that goes on the device.  On two of them, 50% of the "adhesive" (the electrical charge that makes them stick to the screen) was worthless.  Should go straight from the manufacturer to the closest landfill, without tormenting the intervening "customer" (i.e., victim).
B001F2T5RG	OK the most important thing to realize about this product - there are THREE pieces to it.Sticker 1 side - flexibleThe screen protector - hardSticker 2 side - flexibleIf you remove Sticker 1 side first like I did, don't discard it (like I did). There will be two pieces there - Sticker 1 + the hard screen protector. Discard the filmy part with sticker 2 on it. Then put the hard protector + sticker 1 on the screen. Pull off the filmy sticker 1 part and you'll be good to go.I've been at this for 45 minutes and it drove me nuts. I was trying to peel off the sticker from the screen - but that filmy part full of bubbles is NOT the part you put on the screen.They need to include better instructions.I gave it a 2 for the fact that I have a bit of air on one side where it won't lay flat, and because the instructions were not good. I see other folks here ad the exact problem I had. I'll eventually have to get another one because mine won't lay flat on the side. But at least now I know how to do it.
B001F2T5RG	It went on easily, even after I had to peal it off after I "missed" the first time. The enclosed cardboard "smoother" easily got the few bubbles out.  2 months later it hasn't started pealing yet and still looks good.  I wish they didn't insult my intelligence and charge .02 for the item and $2.50 for shipping but for what it does I guess overall $ is reasonable.
B001F2T5RG	I've always been adverse to screen protectors. Prior to my BlackBerry Bold, I had an AT&T Tilt and I had the worst luck with screen protectors on it. I decided to give this screen protector a shot and was pleasantly surprised. These screen protectors were easy to apply and I was able to do so without any air bubbles. If you have a Bold, I would definitely recommend it.
B001F2T5RG	What do you expect for so cheap? You don't like the quality, buy a ten dollar laminated protector or whatever. I don't know about others, but I ordered 4 because of all the trouble posters here had. It cost me less then $3 with free shipping. They came neatly packaged along with a piece of cleaning cloth and a cardboard edger for air bubbles.They are in fact quite easy to put on, provided you know how to do it. You clean your screen with the cloth, put your phone upside down so no more small, invisible to the eye pieces of dust fall, grab the screen protector and lift up the side with the sticker that says apply downwards and make sure it's lined up nicely and do it quickly. Then you peel the top off and you have perhaps the clearest screen protector ever. It looks as if nothing is there. And then you just edge out the air bubbles if possible. Keep in mind, there is nothing the screen protector can do for dust. Don't do it in a dusty environment or put it on with the screen facing downwards, or do it in a plastic bag.I only had to do it once, and though there is a very small piece of dust, I can't see it when the screen is lit. So far, I've had it with my keys, pens etc. And while some slight scratches may appear on the protector it works great, and you cannot see them. You get what you pay for.Ultimately, to any prospective buyers, the price is cheap and the labor is very little. If you know what you're doing you should be fine. Buy extra's just in case.
B001F2T5RG	I didn't find this hard to install.  It was easy ad perfectly fit.  I'm happy.  Not sure if the other reviews were from folks who may have received a different mfg item because they sound different from what I've received.  The shipper would have to say if they have different versions.
B001F2T5RG	The screen protector works fine but I had a hard time getting all of the bubbles out but the protector is a perfect fit for the Blackberry Bold!  You get one screen but it is reusable and it is easy to realign.
B001F2T5RG	It comes with 3, ALL OF THEM had dust and hair and other crap on the sticky side of it when they came. Save another $2 and buy a better one that doesn't come with crap all over it. Left bubbles even after I removed the protector. I've given up hope of finding a screen protector, the only one I've ever had work was one for my ZuneHD.

B001F2T5RG	These screen protectors are a waste of money. They are way to small for the blackberry 9900. I say save your time and money go to the coraprate store (Verizon,Sprint,Tmobile) and purchase the screen protector for your phone.
B001F2T5RG	Having been a user of Palm products for many years, I thought this would be just like the many screen protectors I've bought. I was wrong. It is a harder material than those for the Palm screens, easier to install without bubbles and was reusable. I found that to be true when my Blackberry needed to be repaired. It was easy to remove and went on the new pda without too much hassle.... and it still looks new and remains almost scratch free!
B001F2T5RG	Muchas gracias por su venta, estoy muy complacida con el articulo, esta fue mi primera experiencia en compras por internet.
B001F2T5RG	Product is as advertised.  Clean your screen before applying - as said before, any dust will clearly show up.  I am pretty OCD about my cell phone and, after getting dust on the screen during my first application, had to clean the protector with lens cleaner, let it air dry and reinstall.  My other comment is that the protective cover seems to show more smudges (oil from my face)then the screen alone does.
B001F2T5RG	already dropped my Bold and it got a scratch but it protected the screen. Easy to put on but I recommend buying two in case you mess up the first time, as I did. It's VERY easy to miss a piece of dust on the Bold and you WILL see it after you put the protective screen on.
B001F2T5RG	It would be nice if the protectors could  be installed without air pockets.However, the delivery was on time and the quality of the product is good.
B001F2T5RG	The cover is just what I needed for my phone. I order 5 over them. It is so hard to find covers for blackberry now they are here. Thanks
B001F2T5RG	This is a thick screen protector which effectively protects the screen.  However, since it is so thick, if there is even a small piece of dirt, it will show through the protector.  In addition, after a short period of time, I started getting vertical "shadows" on the screen saver.  I eventually took it off and replaced it with a thinner protector.
B001F2T5RG	The sticker's size is alright, I am somewhat familiar with how to put on a screen protector without leaving many bubbles, so neither posed a problem for me. The deal breaker happened when I tried to remove the sticker that is pasted on the protector as a "handle" to peel it off the backing plastic. That sticker would not come off cleanly. In fact, that sticker would not come off at all. In the end, the sticker left half of itself on my screen protector, meaning I have to remove the protector and throw it away, otherwise I can't see the lower right corner of my phone. Verdict: absolutely useless.
B001F2T5RG	There are many aftermarket screen protectors available for the Blackberry Bold 9000. I've used a few of them. The most common issue is how hard it is to actually apply them to the screen with proper centering and no "bubbles". It turns out that the smallest speck of dust in the screen will cause a bubble that will be noticeable when the screen is off, but invisible when on.All in all, these protectors will help avoid having to replace the screen when dropping the phone. Of course they'll also help prevent scratches, although in more than 6 months of placing my phone in pant and jacket pockets without screen protection, not a single scratch developed, so I guess your mileage will vary.If you decide to get this (or any similar) protector, my best advice is to avoid applying them to the phone in a hurry, as this is likely to result in misalignment. Take the time to thoroughly clean the screen, read the instructions a couple of times and don't make the mistake of assuming that installing the cover is trivial. It's very easy to do it wrong.
B001F2T5RG	MY WATCH DOESN'T WORK LITTE ALMOST NEW. IT WAS WORKING AND SUDDENLY STOP. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT CAN I DO
B001F2T5RG	Reading reviews of others led me to believe that this product was no good. But I take if for what it's worth and decided to purchase this product anyway. This product is excellent -  I had no problems whatsoever with installing the screen protector, no bubbles, no lint. Instructions were easy and straightforward. No issues with visibility of screen. Just make sure you clean your screen properly before placing screen on and you won't have any problems.
B001F2T5RG	It amazes me that people complain about spending a couple bucks on shipping to buy a $.01 item.  Do you really think the screen protector is only worth $.01?  The device is several hundred dollars, do yourself a favor and spend $3 to protect it.  If you have any coordination at all you'll have this on your phone in 20 seconds, couldn't be easier to install.
B001F2T5RG	I received three protectors.. couldn't use any of them..  the sticker in front of the plastic..  did not come of clean..  leaving a layer of glue and paper on the plastic..  I tried to remove with soap and windex and nothing worked.  I had to toss all three of them away.
B001F2T5RG	I have no issues with the product itself. Amazing price, perfect fitment, easy installation and durable and resistant to scratching. The only issue I had was that I paid atleadt 2 to 3 dollars for shipping alone but when it arrived(late) it was in an envelope with a 48 cen stamp. So where I saved money on the actual product I ended up paying for in shipping. It still came out to less than 4 bucks which is still a great deal I just wish they would have charged me less I reccomend this product but I advise finding a cheaper way to ship or get free shipping on this item somehow.
B001F2T5RG	This had only one screen protector. From the product description I got the impression that this package contains three, which was not true. If you remove the protector and try to stick it again, its edges will come off.
B001F2T5RG	Excellent product. For those who had the "white tape" problem, next time read the instructions or visit the website. It is a three piece affair. Bottom plastic protects the sticky side, the top for smudge protection, and the middle is the real protector. After application you take off the top layer with the sticker NOT the sticker itself. I too was irritated at the S&H "scam." Just say it costs $2.
B001F2T5RG	you got what you paid for its so crappy material that it got ripped right the moment i put it on screen!it paper thin thanks alot i didnt got the major stuff from them!buyers plz be aware its ripp off!
B001F2T5RG	This product comes with a plastic on both the front and rear of it and a piece of paper telling you to remove one before installation and the other after installation so the real film is always protected until installation time. When I tried to install it, it went over the edge of the right side of the screen so I had to take it back off, by the time I replaced it there were 2 pieces of lint underneath it so I decided to see if it was really washable and reusable so I washed it with just water, when I was done I air dried it but because of impatience I used the edge of the cloth to just dab the areas and so even more lint got underneath but I was tired so I left it that way.At a later date I removed it and washed it with shampoo but when it dried I saw lots of fingerprints on the sticky side so I washed again with dish washing liquid and the cloth that comes with it to try to get rid of the prints, went outside and air dried it, there were still a few prints and small water spots but it looked better than before so I put it down carefully, sticky side up and cleaned the screen on my bold and reapplied it, this time I only have one bit of lint under it but it's really small and my screen looks great, the prints and spots don't show so I decided to leave it as is, perhaps another time i'll try to get out that last piece of lint but it's really small and negligible.By the way, there's a bit of cardboard that ships with it that is to be used like a squeegee, use this to get out any air bubbles that may occur after installation.
B001F2T5RG	I needed a simple screen protector for my blackberry bold.  This product fits the bill and works as expected.  It comes with helpful instructions, in case you apply the product incorrectly, you can re-apply it (have not tried it, but sounds plausible).
B001F2T5RG	Excellent product, it fits perfectly on my BB Bold, easy installation, you only need to be careful at the time of installation and be in a dust free environment
B001F2T5RG	This product sucks. Pure and simple. It created so many bubbles, one of the key pieces of paper you're meant to remove on the film was so glued on, I had to scrape and use alcohol to get it off completely, and then, after all that work, there was simply no getting around the fact that the brilliance of the Bold screen was significantly diminished with the film on it. I threw it all away in frustration after this 15 minute futile exercise. Don't wast your money people...
B001F2T5RG	I would not recommend this.  It would not seperate and I had to throw it away.
B001F2T5RG	The fit the phone perfect and were extremely cheap and good quality.  The shipment was very quick too! Thanks, would buy again!
B001F2T5RG	I purchased this screen protector after reading the reviews and I have to say I'm glad I did. I bought two as was suggested in an earlier review, but had no problem with putting on the first one.
B001F2T5RG	I have used these types of overlays many times on phones, PDA's, etc. By taking a few simple steps, the process goes smoothly and you get good results. First, The tiny little cleaning cloth that comes with the protector is too small. It's nice that they give you one, but it's easier if you use a big one. I have several of these lying around - they are included when you buy better sunglasses, binoculars or other optics. They give them away at eyeglass shops and camera stores. Get the screen very clean.Next, put on either cotton or latex gloves so you don't smudge the protector as you're putting it on. When applying the protector, be patient. I found it easiest to line it up on the bottom of the screen and gently lay it down. It didn't line up perfectly the first time, but using a plastic ball point pen cap or similar item, you can lift it back off and try again. It may take a few tries to lay it down perfectly aligned.Finally, working from the center using the cleaning cloth, work out the air bubbles. I have never been able to get every single bubble out, but I only see them when the phone is off. When it's illuminated, they are pretty much invisible.Even though this is supposed to be re-usable, what's the point? I keep it clean using the lens cloth until it gets to scratched up or stops sticking down to the screen. At that point, throw it out and get a new one. The last one I had lasted well over a year.
B001F2T5RG	Not as good as advertized...Fits pretty good but I have had some come aloose
B001F2T5RG	Sure, shipping was $2.98 on a .01 product.  But for $2.99, I got a screensaver for my Bold.  Installation was a breeze.  Not sure what others are talking about with difficult installations.  No bubbles at all.  And this is about as clear as you can get.  I'd bet that someone looking at the screen wouldn't even know it was there.The protector has its own protection by having a clear protective layer on each side of the actual protector.  The outside layers are removed during installation.  Installation instructions are simple.  Clean screen, peel off bottom layer (a label attached tells you to pull this side first), apply protector, and remove top layer (again, label attached to tell you to do this).  Done.  Took about 15 seconds to apply.Great product, especially for the price.
B001F2T5RG	I have had this screen protector for my blackberry 9000 for about a year now and it still held up. So far still no issues with this product and it does what it supposed to do, which is protect the screen of the blackberry.
B001F2T5RG	I was looking for something to put on my screen that can get scratched up and eventually removed so the screen itself is in good condition.  I installed it in a flash, and the tiny tiny bubble I left underneath doesn't bother me at all.  It fits just right on the screen, was simple enough to install, and is perfect for a secondary, protective surface.
B001F2T5RG	This is saving the face of my phone.  I'm glad that I paid attention to the details regarding this item.  It fits the face precisely and no new scratches.  Thanks.
B001F2T5RG	The protector comes with two white tapes that need to be removed before inserting the protector. These have been glued on with a really sticky glue that refuses to come out unless washed away with water and alcohol. By the time one does this, the screen looks very unclear and in fact gets creases and what someone else labeled as bubbles. Useless piece of nonsense, that takes a lot of time to install. Please do not waste your money on this product. I ended up throwing the ones I bought. Now I am looking for one that really works.
B001F2T5RG	I bought two units, one each for my wife and myself.I installed mine first, it has 2 bubbles, then i took time to install my wife's own, no bubbles.Its very clear even with the bubble but at least i get to protect my screen from scratches.
B001F2T5RG	Excellent quality and fit. I'm not sure it is reusable though. The protector is made to fit the BB's screen to a T so careful application is required. A slight "miss-alignment" will result in other areas not being attached to the screen.
B001F2T5RG	Instructions were not helpful and the screen protector did not stick on the phone.  Ordered this item, along with the phone casing, from the same vendor, but had to pay separate shipping for both items.
B002UZGZU2	I was a little wary, when I received the package and it was labeled 'iPhone Screen Protector', but it was indeed a protector for a Blackberry. The screen protector went on cleanly, I had no air bubble problem because the tabs that come with it help out a lot.
B002UZGZU2	This is a great product! Excellant quality ! Easy to install , bubble free, just wonderful! It has two tabs to help you seamlessly apply and align this product! This is a five star product! Way to go!
B002UZGZU2	I always feel the need to have screen protectors, and yet I'm not sure they've ever saved a screen for me.  It's kind of like a bra on a car - is it really worth making it ugly all the time to keep it from suffering potential damage?Well, the extra peace of mind may be worth it in this case.  This is hardly visible while the screen is off, and invisible while on, so it bothers me not one bit.  That said, it is about 1 mm too wide, so it overlaps the bevels; if it didn't, then it really might be perfect and invisible while off - a fine row of dust collects under either side.It looks like the people sending this just toss a screen protector and a cloth in an envelope and send.  I say this because I got two cloths off the pile.  The cloth however, is absolutely not lint free and not all that soft, either.  Almost more of a detriment than helpful.  So use a cloth that comes with your sunglasses or tv instead if you have one and you'll be alright.At least you can buy one for cheap and try it out.  I wouldn't doubt if the manufacturing tolerances allow some to fit more perfectly than mine.  Either way, I'd probably buy again.
B002UZGZU2	This screen protector is not really good or extremely bad. The instructions on how to install suck, I had to go to youtube to see how its done. Also the paper was really hard to peel off of the adhesive side. I do like the cloth they provide to keep the dust away. I used some scissors to lightly scratch the protector and it totally failed that test. I'm not sure this will protect your phone to much and if you drop your phone often I can imagine you will have to buy several of these. For the price its worth getting though.
B003VTZPLQ	These screen guards work well.  They fit the droid x perfect.  A few air bubbles but nothing noticeable when the phone's backlight is on.  Work about as well as any screen guard can. Plus you get 15 of them.  So if you mess up on putting one on it is not the end of the world.
B003VTZPLQ	I bought these screen protectors for my Droid X and found them to be absolute junk.They are difficult to apply without air bubbles, and the squeegee they supply scratches the protectors! Just taking the phone in and out of a pocket causes them to start peeling off.  They are not exactly the size of the screen (about 1mm small on all four sides), and they do not allow for smooth swiping motions.I ended up going to the Verizon store to get their screen protectors which while more expensive are far superior in every way.Lesson learned: You get what you pay for!
B003VTZPLQ	This product works just as well, if not a little easier than the ones that I bought from the Verizon store. And they are way cheaper. I would highly recommend, and definitely buy again, even though with such a large pack, I probably won't ever have to.
B003VTZPLQ	These screen protectors seem great at first.  They go on easier than just about any other screen protector I've ever used, and they are perfectly sized.  But after a week or so they start shrinking and no longer cover the entire screen.  As each day passes, they shrink a little more and a little more.  I've gone through four of them now, all with the same outcome.  And even though they are static cling, they still leave a residue on the screen after removing them that can be tough to completely remove.
B004ND3GMO	EDIT 6/26/2012 - It broke after about 2.5 weeks and I didnt even use it every day - Got in my car this morning and the Mount was on the floor and the cup was still on the window, it just popped off and the phone wasn't even in the dock. The Suction cup seperated from the mount and looks like there was a plastic inner ring portion in the cup that was part of the mount. You get what you pay for I guess... lowered from 4 to 1 star.------------------------------------ Original Review Below -----------------------------------------I bought this mount for my HTC Incredible mostly because of the price. As a bonus it looked like a low profile mount. Compared to most of the other Universal type mounts that have huge side grips that close on your device and stick out like sore thumbs, this one is much neater looking.I just upgraded to a Motorola Razr Maxx and it still fits fine even with a case. The suction cup and lever that locks it in place are sturdy and the mount swivels and tightens for keeping your device at the desired angle.Its a little noisy when the phone is not inserted and it seems like it can break if handled roughly, but for the price I can deal with it until it breaks.
B004Y0R9DI	I waited for the product for a week! It is easy to take it on the screen and it hides well the fingerprints.
B004Y0R9DI	While the screen protector is very easy to install, they do an average job eliminating finger smudges. However, they do an excellent job diffusing glare and the protector is still a better option than not having one at all.
B004Y0R9DI	The price for this item was great for 3 protectors. It fits well over all the cut outs for camera, home button, etc. It was not difficult to install but I got a few dust particles near the edge trapped which I could not get out so it is not perfect.I love the anti-glare feature. I have used the shiny type and I definitely prefer anti-glare. I still have 2 more left which hopefully I will not need to apply if this one stays on. Considering what some vendors charge for 1 screen protector this was a really good deal.
B004Y0R9DI	I like the way if feels to the touch.  It doesn't feel tacky and I notice how it doesn't even look like there is a protector on my Iphone.
B004Y0R9DI	the best screen protector for me. tried all the others, only takes about two of these to get it right.
B004Y0R9DI	works great.  doesn't reduce glare but works well otherwise.  nice packaging and appears to have goo customer service but i never had to use it.
B004Y0R9DI	I was skeptical that these screen protectors would work for being so inexpensive, but I was pleasantly surprised! The anti-glare attribute is very nice as well. You cannot tell the difference in these protectors from ones that cost 3x more!
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors are the best ones I have used so far for my iPhone. Unlike others, the really are anti-glare and are easy to replace as well. Excellent value for a three pack.
B004Y0R9DI	Very easy to put on phone...ordered extras in case. The protectors are of great quality. Was worried that the anti-glare would not enable me to see everything as clear as the clear protector but it works perfect. Highly highly recommend
B004Y0R9DI	I ordered these for my Iphone 5.  The plastic seems like it would be a decent cover but the item did not match the advertised picture at all.  It did not cover the whole screen from top to bottom and the ridiculous thing is that it did not have any cutout areas for the home button, phone speaker or front camera; making them kind of useless.I would look elsewhere if you have an Iphone 5.
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors are amazing, they go on pretty easy and and the pack comes with everything you need to get it done the first time. The anti-glare part of the screen protector is what makes it amazing, you doesn't even seem like you have a screen protector on your iphone.
B004Y0R9DI	I have a hate/hate relationship with screen protectors. No matter how easy the company says they are, no matter how wonderful they claim to be, they have bubbles. That is right, bubbles.So when this arrived unannounced in the mail, I nearly threw them in the trash. I don't DO screen protectors. But since they sent the correct size for my 5S, I figured the worst I could do is spend a couple of minutes putting one on. Imagine my shock - NOT A SINGLE BUBBLE!So I went to test number 2 - how does it work - will my phone still recognize my finger as easily? Yep, not even the tiniest hesitation. Instead of peeling it off (like I intended to do after the test), I left it on.A couple of notes. Generiks sells fingerprint-free film. This isn't it. It does collect prints. But it does protect the surface of my iPhone.I took off a star because it doesn't fully fit side to side, almost, just not quite! EDITED - See company comment below. There is a purpose for it not fitting side to side - it is to make sure that covers fit correctly. :-)
B004Y0R9DI	I had no difficulty putting the protector on the iPhone.  Clean the face well and follow the instructions.  A good feature is that the protector covers the entire face of the phone and not just the screen.
B004Y0R9DI	I've purchased other screen protectors on Amazon that didn't quite fit (a little crooked or large), and this one is a perfect fit. Transfer went smoothly and didn't have any bubbles that I didn't get out with the little plastic card. With the great price I'll definitely be buying these again whenever I need them!
B004Y0R9DI	I purchased the screen protector for my iPhone 5.  It goes on easy, no bubbles, very clear...it does a great job for $6.95.  More importantly, initially Amazon sent the wrong protectors, that didn't fit the iPhone 5 and Amazon wouldn't let me return it.  So I left a negative review, which the seller immediately responded to, and shipped out the correct protector via FedEx.  Excellent customer service.
B004Y0R9DI	I wasn't expecting much because of the price but, I was wrong. The product is just as described. I will buy more.
B004Y0R9DI	I just bought these to put on a phone of mine that previously had a similar screen protector that I got from Apple. Honestly there really isn't any appreciable difference. It keeps the glare and fingerprints down and it went on prety easy. Plus I got a 3-pack for less than $8, I paid double that for two from Apple and that one already needed to be replaced. Great product
B004Y0R9DI	i've used several different screen protectors on a wide variety of my electronics, and i was very pleasantly surprised by generiks.the screen protectors and various installation aids come packaged in a simple heavy gauge plastic zip lock bag. the instructions included were concise and even had a useful troubleshooting tip i hadn't heard of before.included with the screen protectors was a micro fiber cleaning cloth, cardboard air pocket smoothing tool, and a dust removing aid (some adhesive paper). many of the cheaper screen protectors don't come with the extras, so this was a nice bonus for the price.the protectors themselves are good quality anti-glare covers. colors remain true with it on, and there isn't bad pixelation that can occur with bad quality anti-glare covers.i am very happy with these! great price and great quality, will look for generiks next time i need a new cover.
B004Y0R9DI	Wen on easily enough, no bubbles.  Get's oily easily, but can be wiped clean easily as well.  Has survived several encounter with my keys in my pocket
B004Y0R9DI	I had the screen protector on my phone for about 2 weeks so far its been great and keeps my phone scratch free! The cut outs are perfect and was very easy to install. They give you a cleaning cloth with it. Very fast shipping which is a plus. Im very happy with my purchase and would buy these again!
B004Y0R9DI	Generiks screen protectors for the iPhone 5/5s works as advertised. The instructional video they offer for applying the screen protector on YouTube.com was very helpful as well. I'm glad It came in a three pack, because I messed up on the ( bubbled up too much & hair got caught inside ) first one I applied, but learned from my mistake on 2nd. go. No bubbles, scratches, hair inside, etc. My only advise is to watch the video, and be patient when applying the screen protector. Thank you Generiks for a great product! I rate it 4 out of 5 stars.
B004Y0R9DI	Most screen protection films are so expensive and you only get one! I found this great product and you get three in case you screw one up and for future use. Easy to apply. Color on screen stays pretty clean and bright. No more fingerprints!! Yeah!
B004Y0R9DI	Lost connections with this cover.  Very frustrating! No one should waste their money on this!Not able to use these at all!
B004Y0R9DI	I ordered for my iPhone 5. Definitely not anti-glare.  The cover looks cheap with one oversized hole around all sensors, etc on top instead of individual holes. And the bottom below the home button is open. Why skimp out on a tiny bit more plastic? I guess you get what you pay for. Otherwise it works fine as a screen protector, but I'll skip it next time for something with actual anti-glare and better protection. Shipping took longer than expected as well.
B004Y0R9DI	First of all I liked the way it fitted on the phone without any bubbles. And then the texture of the phone's screen is amazing.I would recommend this to anyone.
B004Y0R9DI	I Understand that the purpose of a screen guard is to avoid the scratches on screen. But this one looks ugly as the screen guard itself gets scratched easily. I am IT guy and this screen guard after only a month of use is scratched at several places and quite visibly. I hadle my phone very carefully. But, This thing gets scratched even by just taking in and out of pocket.But my screen is protected and no Bubbles. so 3 stars
B004Y0R9DI	All three screen protectors arrived with a big crease in the same area even though the packaging wasn't damaged.  This means that no matter what i do there is an air bubble in the same area of the screen on both my and my wife's iPhones.
B004Y0R9DI	Does the a great job, but more darkens the screen and is more matte than I would like. I hav been using it for 3 months without issue.
B004Y0R9DI	I had no issues installing the anti-glare screen protector on my new iPhone--it was very easy.  The screen does reduce glare significantly and I am fully satisfied with my purchase.  I am happy that I didn't spend 3X+ more $s on another brand.
B004Y0R9DI	Received these but they didn't have the proper cut outs for the Iphone 5 display and the package was clearly labelled for Iphone 5. Also if applied it would have only protected 2/3rds of the screen surface.  Returned them since they were obviously defective.  Received the anti glare variety in the same brand and it was much better and cut for the iphone 5 perfectly.
B004Y0R9DI	I had such high hopes for this product since it got good reviews.  I tried installing it on my iphone 5 but it didnt seem to fit right.  it was always off to the left. i wasted all 3 screen protectors.  not buying this again.
B004Y0R9DI	First off, this product seems to be very high quality, and the price is excellent for three of them.  It fits the phone well.  Installation is pretty easy, but be careful not to pull the newly-installed screen protector off when you remove the outer protective film.  (There are three individual layers of film on each screen protector, and only the middle one is supposed to end up on the phone.  The outer two keep the middle one clean before and during installation.)The clear ones are essentially invisible once they're on the phone.  I had a clear protector on my old phone and was happy with that, but I play a fair number of games and wanted to try out the fingerprint-resistant version on my new iPhone 5.  The matte finish makes the phone just slightly less attractive in my opinion, but it does cut down on fingerprints by about 90%, so I'd say it's a net gain.Another negative with the fingerprint-resistant version is that it makes the screen just slightly less clear (I'm not entirely sure how to describe it, but the effect is like cutting the resolution slightly).  It's not a big deal, but if you care a lot about such things, it could bother you.  Personally, I noticed when I first put it on and thought it was a little bit of a bummer, but on subsequent viewings it doesn't bother me.  If I had to put a number on it, I'd say the image quality on my screen is about 95% as good with this screen protector on it as it is without it.P.S. I'm hoping this review shows up for all versions of this product for all iPhones.  I bought the ones for the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5, but Amazon wouldn't let me write reviews on both products.
B004Y0R9DI	Ok, maybe I have lower standards for screen protectors than some.  I simply want one that doesn't require tape, showers, and a lot of luck to apply without getting those annoying bubbles.  This one is perfect.  Why can't they all be this easy?
B004Y0R9DI	This purchase was nothing but a waste of time and money.  The screen protector is cut too short and does not have the appropriate cutouts for the button.  Or if you raise it up, it does not have cut outs for the speaker.  Either way, it is about 2/3rds the length it should be. It is also too wide on the sides.  Additionally, even when carefully following instructions, the protector bubbles horribly and is hazy.  While the haze could fade in a few days, I did not keep the screen protector on long enough to find out, because it was just too terribly sized to be tolerable.
B004Y0R9DI	Love these screen covers... they are inexpensive, durable, good quality and ship quickly.For the absolute best results applying these screen protectors, follow the tip about running a hot shower to clear dust from the air in your bathroom... it really works!!!!
B004Y0R9DI	When you're searching for an anti-glare screen protector, you're looking for two things: Anti-glare (obviously) and smudge free. What you wish you had is a &#34;Retina compatible&#34; or a clear anti-glare, which is near impossible to find. So at the price of a distorted color display, you get a nice, smooth anti-glare screen. However, the Generiks Screen Protector, like my title says, meets you halfway. It's an amazing and quite affordable product, I'd recommend it to anyone that loves the texture of an anti-glare but wants the beauty of the retina as well.PROS: Very clear for an anti-glare only has a very small amount of distortion if you look closely. Huge improvement over standard anti-glares.CONS: At the cost of clarity, the screen protector is quite thin and has less texture to it than other brands. It's not very anti-glare either. Fingerprints do get on the screen as well, but not as much compared to a bare screen. It's also not a &#34;protector&#34;. The anti-glare WILL get scratches/dings and is too thin and flimsy to protect anything. It's more of a feel and look.
B004Y0R9DI	The screen protectors are of high quality and applied easily. After a month it still is perfectly intact.  a good price for what u get
B004Y0R9DI	These anti-glare screen protectors are a great value for the price. They have nice smooth matte finish and are very resistant to scratching. This is my second time purchasing them. After my first time, I bought a different anti-glare protector and it was flimsier and scratched very easily. I only used one of those screen protectors from that pack, gave the rest away and bought the Genericks ones again.Highly recommended!!
B004Y0R9DI	This is such a good protector for such a small price! It only took me two tries to get it perfectly on. I now have an extra cover just in case this one falls off somehow. It comes with a credit card like pusher to get rid of air bubbles and a cloth. Really easy to put on! I'm very impatience and this did not take long to put on at all.
B004Y0R9DI	I purchased the 3 pack of these clear screen protectors. I'm usually horrible at putting these on phones but I installed one of these perfectly on my first try! The speaker/camera/home button holes were cut out perfectly.
B004Y0R9DI	This item came early in the mail, was very easy to install on my phone and looks great! Would highly recommend this screen protector to any iPhone user!
B004Y0R9DI	These are easy to apply and a great price!  The only thing I would change is that I dont like the texture (its a bit scratchy) and I feel like i have to wet my fingers to use them (kinda like a chalkboard).  I prefer the glossy ones.
B004Y0R9DI	This screen protector has worked very well for me.  It's a lot more affordable than what they sell at the AT&T store with comparable quality.
B004Y0R9DI	Today I was using a stylus and with the corner of it the metal scratched the phone REALLY bad. So i was really scared to take it (the screen protector) off but i did.... And what do you know no scratch at all!!! Im so glad. I will be ordering from them again! The only bad thing i have to say is it gets alot of fingerprints but thats fine because you dont notice it when you are using the phone.Pros: Scratch Restistent, fits perfectly good cut outs, adds no elavation to the screen on the phone itself, fits with cases snuggly, and keeps the clear retnia display.Cons: fingerprint magnet but you dont realize it when the phone is onI would most definetly reccommend this to a friend.
B004Y0R9DI	works great.  easy to install, just make sure your phone is clean and you are extremelly carefull.  good luck, slow and steady install!
B004Y0R9DI	First of all I've used a lot of difference Greenshields everything from glass does some high-end plastic screen shields this screen shield which has a matte finish is not quite well Oleophobic like some screen shield but it is anti-fingerprint it's not crystal-clear but it has a pretty clear look to it. The finish is not near as frosted as some I have seen be images are quite clear coming through the screen shield in the feel of the screen shield is nice slick kind of feel that doesn't have the grippy feel of most plastics sreenshieldspros I like the cut out for the camera and speaker it has a nice generous cut out for the home buttonI have never been fond of the frosted screen shields but I do like the look and feel of this oneVery easy to apply the only secret that I could tell you is using a can of compressed air right before to blow the fine dust off seems to make for a perfect install every timeconWith some screen shields I have installed the protective coating is a different color blue sometimes greenwhich makes it a little easier to lineup the screen shieldTo summarize this is a great screen shield for the price to get three in a pack makes it very nice. I was sent this screen shield for review
B004Y0R9DI	I purchased these after my loving husband put my Otterbox screen protector on wrong I couldn't stand it anymore.  I was thinking they'd be flimsy little covers but for the price and the quantity, they'd be fine.  Well, I sure was wrong! They are heavy and thick screen protectors and go on easily! It gives the screen almost a matte finish but I didn't notice it the next day anymore.  The cut outs are a perfect fit for the iPhone 5 so a little adjusting in the beginning helps place it on perfectly.  I haven't had any issues with it affecting the touch screen or curling up on the corners.  It actually fits my Otterbox case better because the screen protector goes all the way to the end of the device, instead of stopping a bit in, so my case holds down the sides.  Really like it and recommended it to a few friends and family already!
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors are great and easy to install. Non glare is a must. Would recommend these to others as well as the seller!
B004Y0R9DI	Bought this for new iPhone 5.  Been using it for over a week, no fingerprints and does well in reducing the glare.  I haven't noticed any significant decrease in screen resolution.  The package includes what you need to do a good install including a mini credit card to smooth out any bubbles.  Very happy with it.
B004Y0R9DI	After reading all the comments, i was expecting it to be worthwhile. SOme people said they had bubbling issues, while others had application issues. My application was fine. It came out perfect, with next to no bubbles because I used water. However, Each time after everything dried up, the screen protector had this mark on it, in which I couldn't clean. I tried under and on top. All 3 of my screen protectors had it.
B004Y0R9DI	I Received quickly with excellent instructions for application.  It applies easily AND it fits my iPhone 5S!  I really like the non-glare screen!
B004Y0R9DI	I have alot of experiance putting on screen protectors so this was a breeze. It is cut perfect for the phone and sits on the phone alot better then a couple other i have tried for the iPhone 5. It comes with 3 of them and a cleaning cloth. Take your time and ensure that you really clean the phone well. when you take the one side off to stick to the phone hold it so you remove the sheet down so no dust gets on the screen protector. If you hold the protector up you will get it full of dust and get bumbs when applying to the phone.  Looks great and cuts the glare and finger prints.
B004Y0R9DI	I just put this on a couple hours ago, and it already looks like a CSI technician's wet dream.  It's not anti-fingerprint at all.  I feel like it reduces the brightness/clarity of the screen, the cutouts are not exactly right, and it seems to be less responsive with this protector on it.  Not to mention it took weeks for them to fill and ship my order.
B004Y0R9DI	It's a perfect fit in my estimation. I bought these last year and have gone through the others already. Can't go wrong with these protectors. They'll last me another year for sure. Helps my phone slide easily in and out of my pocket so it's perfect for me.
B004Y0R9DI	I had previously bought the same thing for my iPhone 4 and thought they were pretty good.  These had to have been mispackaged or something because there was no anti-glare / matte effect at all!  This was a glossy screen protector that had big scratches after a few days.  Avoid this and get the Spigen anti-glare matte film for the iPhone 5 instead - it beats others hands down.
B004Y0R9DI	as it say....no bubbles....I am terrible at replacing the screen protector on my phones....with this it was easy...and not one bubble....would buy it again...and would tell others to buy this product also.....
B004Y0R9DI	The protector is slightly thicker than those cheap ones sold on eBay or elsewhere. I used to buy those for my previous phone. Big mistake. The cheaper ones get bubbles and scratch a lot more easily. I ended up replacing them more often. After trying the genericks, there is no turning back.  Easy to apply with little bubble at all. Great value.
B004Y0R9DI	I love how this product protects my screen while keeping away nasty finger prints and whatnot. Also the fact that I can read my phone from any angle without trying to find a position that doesnt creat glare is wonderful.
B004Y0R9DI	These are nice quality screen protectors, equal to those costing much more.  I would highly recommended this product.  As usual, it was good to have three; these are reasonably easy to install, but I still ruined one.
B004Y0R9DI	Purchased the Clear and the anti-fingerprint protector from same company/maker to see which one gave me a clear protection without distorting the images. Well, tried the Clear first because thr anit-fingerprint looked &#34;milky&#34;. As I was placing the Clear &#34;scratch-free&#34; film on my phone with the enclosed tool, the tool itself SCRATCHED the surface of the protective film... Need I say more?
B004Y0R9DI	If you just want basic protection for your iPhone screen these are inexpensive and great. The stop scratches from getting on the creen and are fairly easy to apply
B004Y0R9DI	After using my friend's iPhone 4, with the anti-fingerprint screen protector from Generiks, I decided to get my own for my iPhone 5.  However, unlike his, I get fingerprints all over mine... I thought perhaps I had received the wrong item, until I discovered that my other friend who also just ordered theirs is having the exact same problem with fingerprints.  I sent them an inquiry about perhaps having received the wrong order a few days ago, I still haven't heard back from them.
B004Y0R9DI	Very Good! A little hard to get installed correctly (but all the protectors seem to have this). It has held up very well and I am still using the first one I installed.
B004Y0R9DI	I still think that iPhone is the best designed piece of consumer electronics - ever. It is elegant, highly functional, and very light and compact. Which is why I hate putting any extra accessories and protectors on top of it. However, over the years I've dropped my iPhone(s) quite few times, end even though there has never been any serious damage, those rough physical impacts have left their mark in terms of various small scratches and bumps. So in the end I cannot but resort to using screen protectors and cases.Here is my breakdown of various aspects of this Generiks screen protector.Application - 4 stars. All these screens are relatively hard to install, and I have never managed to get the job done right on the first try.Protection - 4.5 stars. The screen seems pretty scratch thick. However, it will acquire its own share of scratches. You will probably need replacing it after several months of use.Anti-glare - 4 stars. The screen manages to substantially reduce the glare in broad daylight, but it doesn't completely eliminate it.Screen vibrancy - 3.5 stars. Having this screen protector on your iPhone 5 or 5S will definitely diminish a lot of the beauty and color vibrancy of that display.Anti-fingerprint - 3 stars. The screen protector still attracts a fair share of fingerprints. It's better than the iPhone's screen in its own right , but not by much.Price - 5 stars. It's really hard to beat $5 for three screen protectors, which is the price for which this pack sells for right now on Amazon.Overall impression - 4 stars. It's a decent, inexpensive screen protector, but not the best one you could get for your iPhone 5/5S.
B004Y0R9DI	product quality, packing and delivery was as mentioned in the page. I would recommend this product to anyone else who wants a screen protector for iPhone 4/4S
B004Y0R9DI	I usually buy invisibleShield covers for my iphone but i thought i would try Generiks as it was a a couple of dollars cheaper and you get 3 in a pack.  I chose the clear kind as i read "anti fingerprint" is matte.  My wife has a matte screen protector and it looked a little dim.  Overall, in my opinion invisibleShield is a better product.  These don't stick as well and the first one i tried peeled off and got dirty so i used the 2nd one.  Lucky, they come 3 in a pack.  The corner of the cover is still lifting upp but tolerable.I've been using various covers for my iphone and ipads so its not the first time, i've put on a cover.  Are they pretty good covers for the price?  Yes and ultimately, it does its job.  Is it the same quaity as invisibleShield?  I don't think so.  If i had to do it again, i would probably get the other one as i only needed one.Just a comment on the corner lifting.  Besides my screen protector, i have a iphone cover that wraps around the back and sides of my phone.  The edge of the cover must be putting some pressure and causing it to lift.  It worked fine with the other brand so i'm not sure why this is lifting except that the cover feels less "sticky" to me.  If you are just covering your iphone without any case, it may be fine.
B004Y0R9DI	Well, I have an I-Phone 5 that needs the surface to be protected.  This screen protector does its job.  I'm satisfied with this product.
B004Y0R9DI	Received on time - burt two of the three sheets had the cutouts for the menu button, camera and ear in the wrong places. all of the sheets were a little too big for the iPhone 5 as well. if not for those issues (which to me are pretty big for this product) the screen works fine and I am ok with it.i think the cost of the three was still cheaper than getting this type of screen protector at a big box store.
B004Y0R9DI	This right here is a quality screen protector for a very fair price. I have worked in the cell phone industry for 3 years and no longer in the profession. Couple things I learned is MARGIN on accessories is extremely high and price does not ultimately decide on quality. That last part is still decided upon the manufacturer. GENERIK AG/AF is a very nice at breaking up the glare and does a good job to reduce glare down 70%. The fingerprints are reduced by 55%. Do not expect this to be a 100% matte screen but a mix of matte/clear. This will result in a good mix of VIVID RETINA DISPLAY CLARITY with added ANTI GLARE/ANTI FINGER PRINT. The only reason I would not give this film 5 stars is I believe if the film was double the price it would be much better quality and reduce the glare and finger prints even further while having no effect on reducing screen quality. The iphone 5 screen has amazing color saturation and the retina display is gorgeous. Why ruin it with low quality film when we can keep making improvements. Now as a consumer you need to decide what you think and my personal opinion this film is AMAZING BANG FOR BUCK value and @ $5-$7 for 3 of them is a no brainer.
B004Y0R9DI	Not really a perfect fit at all (at least not for the iPhone 4s), but at this price it'll do just fine. Plus you get 3, not just 1- and a few extra accessories. Even though I gave it a low rating, I don't regret my purchase & recommend it.
B004Y0R9DI	The product was delivered on time. Easy to apply to the phone. Good protection for the phone screen. I always wind up with random change in my pocket so it is great to protect the screen.
B004Y0R9DI	I had an issue with the first one I installed staying on after I installed my case but other than that it is nice.
B004Y0R9DI	Shopped around a lot and settled on these based on the reviews, and I have to say I was not misled.  I barely notice the screen protectors on the screen and there is hardly any reduction in screen sensitivity.  Also, the protector was not too difficult to apply, though I think one or two infinitesimally small bubbles are inevitable but acceptable.  I applied it in 60 seconds so I suppose if you're more careful you could avoid that.  Overall, best screen protectors I've used.
B004Y0R9DI	Nice package with some extra things to help installing the screen protector, overall good quality and reasonable price, recommend this
B004Y0R9DI	I've used antiglare screen protectors for my previous phones, and while they slightly degrade resolution, they prevent scratches and also prevent fingerprints from showing. The Generiks protector film works well for antiglare purposes, and it degrades resolution on my iPhone 5 only very slightly. But it is really poor at preventing fingerprints from skin oils. I've had one on for about 12 hours, and the screen is smeared with fingerprints and swipe marks. My previous phone's film never showed this amount of smearing after days without cleaning. On the positive side, it was easy to apply. Not sure if I'll keep this on the phone or not; the iPhone's new glass is supposed to be tougher to scratch, and this film is only so-so for the other purposes.
B004Y0R9DI	Generiks got it right! They know that if a client is spending the extra money for an iPhone 5, then any case or accoutrements for that investment must be of equal value. This packet of three screen protectors not only comes with an excellent instruction sheet for installment directions and aftercare (including how to remove the screen protector to replace it with a new one), but at the top of that info sheet, in bold letters, is the Generics website address and customer service telephone number. That may not seem like much on first glance, but for those who expect good service it is a reassurance that we are in good hands with assistance just a phone call away form a company that cares about its product.It is likely that assistance will not be needed, however, because this anti-glare bubble free screen protector is VERY easy to install. It covers the entire screen for maximum protection and has no annoying little flaps that can become sticky with use and cause problems. Any marks or fingerprints on the installed screen are easily and completely removable with a quick wipe.For those who have tried other screen protectors, for the money it would be hard to find a product as well designed and reliable as this. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, November 13
B004Y0R9DI	As expected! Great product to use! It went on easily and looks great so that I would reccommend it as well!
B004Y0R9DI	This one is very good.. Just have to be careful while applying and put in the effort initally to have all dust removed before applying and also to remove all bubbles before removing the final protective layer and u have a winner here.. The packaging of the product could be better but for 5$, I am not complaining..
B004Y0R9DI	I ordered the 3 pack and got it within 2 days (thanks prime).Applied it right away and the whole application process is EASY.  Just follow the directions and its not hard.  I put it on my iPhone 4s and only took a few minutes... and there's no air bubbles or multiple applications.  I still have 2 left as spares.This beats zagg's invisible shield line.  Those are a pain to apply and you have to use liquid to do it (causing air bubbles).
B004Y0R9DI	Great for my iphone 4s. If you follow the instructions it comes out awesome. I would highly recommend this protector to anyone.
B004Y0R9DI	Great product.
B004Y0R9DI	Not only is the cost of this screen protector attractive, the application is the easiest of many protectors that I have tried. I used to order mine from China but with a domestic supplier that has them at the same cost, why bother? Will buy more for sure!
B004Y0R9DI	I was so worried about getting bad covers through amazon, just because of some of the reviews that are written online. But when I got my package, I was really happy. There were three covers as promised, the covers are matte, and they look really good on the phone. It is just pretty difficult to put the cover in the correct placement. I had to take it off and put it back on a couple of times. Also, it's very important to make sure there is no dust on your phone before you put the cover on. The tiniest piece of dust will make a bubble and you CANNOT get it out. I just have one bubble at the very top and its really small so it doesn't cause a problem. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase!
B004Y0R9DI	skin resolution is lower and smoothness is not good. Delivery was in time though and no problem with applying the skin to my iphone 5. However product quality is really bad.
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors can be a real rip-off.  This product is a great value for the price paid.  Two thumbs up!
B004Y0R9DI	If you are looking for a no glare, no fingerprint protector this is the one. Love the look and feel. Just remember Anti-Glare Anti-Fingerprint protectors give your screen a matte finish so if you don't like this look try something else.
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors are just as advertised.  As with any protector, the trick is to get in installed correctly.  Once on the phone, the results are perfect.  I have always preferred the non-glare protectors to not only prevent glare, but reduce the smudges from usage.  This product achieves both.
B004Y0R9DI	Some minor issues on the lower part of the screen, below the rounded button and the edge, not sticking to the glass, but other than that it's fine.
B004Y0R9DI	Three stars for the shipping company.  Product gets zero. They do not stickHave been refunded and sent second set that still don't stick. I guess I got what I paid for here.  Nothing!!
B004Y0R9DI	I needed to replace the screen protector that came with my Otterbox Defender case.  Not happy with the fit, unable to remove the air bubbles.  The first two protectors did not install very well. Both had air bubbles that I couldn't get rid of.  The third try was successful.  Recommend that you clean the iPhone screen very very well and try to do it in a dust free environment if possible.  The optical clarity is very good and the feel is good. It's not sticky like some screen protectors. The durability seems to be pretty good.  Left the first protector installed for a couple of weeks to see how it held up.  Fit is very good although the ear hole is slightly larger than it needs to be on one side.  For the price I would buy these again.
B004Y0R9DI	My boyfriend and I just put this screen protector on our new iphone 5's. After reading quite a few tech reviews, we decided on this one because of the price. You get a 3 pack for less than $10! It was so easy to apply. We were careful and each got it done on our first try. Any bubbles or dust were a snap to get out with the enclosed microfiber cloth and pre-installation film. I highly recommend this screen protector!!
B004Y0R9DI	These protectors are as nice as the ones from the phone store for a fraction of the price. Easy to install and no bubbles!
B004Y0R9DI	The anti-glare and anti-fingerprint claim is spot on and it fits perfectly for my iPhone5. This is a great deal =)
B004Y0R9DI	The protection is fine, and I loved the kit, but the first one I used came off within a week.  Hoping to have better luck with the next one.
B004Y0R9DI	Works well.The online videos did not show application to iPhone 5. This was important because there is a protective layer over the protective layer and I did not know that. Ruined one of three.
B004Y0R9DI	I've tried just about every screen protector out there, from the premium priced films like Powersupport and SGP to the really cheap no-name brands that made it appear as if I had just smeared oil all over my phone's screen.  After reading the reviews and ratings for these protectors, I decided to try them and I'm glad I did.  They fit the iPhone 5 perfect, have a decent feel with little to no noticeable friction, and don't have any anomalies like rainbow patterns or other issues.  It took me two tries to get a nice, even, bubble-free application but at a cost of less than two bucks per sheet, I didn't feel too bad about not getting it right the first time and I still have a spare.  The biggest problem, as with all static protectors, is the film's aggressive attraction to the screen, so you really have to make sure you line it up just right before applying.  You also have to apply it to a clean screen as quickly as possible because static attracts dust very quickly.  However, I prefer static because I don't want any adhesives on my screen due to risk of residue.  Case in point, even the factory plastic protectors that the iPhone shipped in left a little residue on the back of my phone that I had to clean right after removing it from the box.Despite my best efforts, I got a couple dust particles trapped under the film during my first try, so I cleaned my phone again, prepped another film, held my breath and luckily got it right on the second attempt.  Once I got the film properly applied, my iPhone 5 screen looked great!  The retina display was not degraded at all.  I even compared it to my naked 4S and the 5's screen looked much better even with a film on it than the bare 4S screen.  Granted, some of that can be attributed to the 5's better screen quality but if this film degraded that quality at all, it should at least make it more comparable to or worse than the 4S, not remain considerably sharper and more crisp.  Unlike the product photo, the speaker and camera cutouts aren't separate, it is one cut-out for both, which I actually prefer because it makes it easier to apply by allowing a little more margin for error during alignment.  Despite being a one-piece cutout, it leaves virtually none of the screen exposed other than the speaker and camera, so it's a total non-factor.  Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on a high priced protector or a cheesy 90-cent protector that will turn your screen into a rainbow.  These are definitely worth the money and every bit as good or better than protectors costing twice as much or more.  Also, this comes with three films.  Most expensive brands give you only one or two at most.  There is nothing cheap or flimsy about these whatsoever when compared to "premium" priced films.  The only difference is that you'll save more money than the person who just had to have the chic brand name.  It all comes down to how much you're willing to spend on the same quality product.
B004Y0R9DI	Extremely good quality. The protector have been used for one year, still looks line new. I will buy it again
B004Y0R9DI	This was exactly as I expected and is still working just fine.  They were easy to put on my phone and I have not had any issues.
B004Y0R9DI	This is a set of protection screens for an iPhone 5S.  The package contains 3 screen protectors and a special sticky film that helps remove the final lint and dust on the phone screen before you apply the protective screen. There is also a set of basic instructions on installing the screen protectors.The instructions to install the protectors are very clear and I basically cleaned my phone with a microfiber towel and then used the cleaning film and the screen of the phone was nice and clean.  I then installed the protector just like the instructions state.  The final job was pretty good with no bubbles and no ugly dust or lint under the protector.The protector does not go all the way to the edges of the phone but my wife has several minimalist phone cases that slightly wrap around the front edges of the phone so I tried one of those cases and the film fit pretty well.  I always have a little trouble installing screen protectors to get them perfectly straight but I have seen so called professionals have the same problem. The iPhone 5S fingerprint reader worked fine after the installation.  The screen image of the retina screen is not as good with a screen protector and that is a tradeoff that you will have to decide on.  It was just OK after I installed the protector.  Is it better to protect your phone or have the screen uncovered and more likely to get scratched or damaged?  That is a personal decision that each phone owner has to make.I don't always use screen protectors as many of my phone cases have had pre-installed protectors as part of the case.  This is a good protector and what I liked most was that selling price is fair.  I have seen some protectors that cost much more for one or two films and these have a reasonable price. They do show fingerprints but no worse than the screen protector on my OtterBox Defender case.  Based on the look and feel of the protector and the price I give these a 5 star review as a good buy.  They can protect your expensive iPhone 5 or 5S which increases your trade in value of your phone when you upgrade.I received a sample product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors don't provide as good visibility as the more expensive brands like Belkin. My display is significantly harder to read than it was with the Belkin on it. It is easier to position and adhere, however. It's a good value for the price, but once I've used the included screen protectors, I'll purchase the more expensive brand again.
B004Y0R9DI	Great product. You get 3 pairs of screen protectors (6 total)! You get 2 diamond protectors, 2 anti-glare protectors, and 2 plain protectors. Extremely easy to apply and comes with a micro cloth to clean the screen and a small smoothing tool to make sure there are no bubbles. Overall a great and easy product
B004Y0R9DI	These protectors are too wide for the iPhone 5 and easily peel back on the edges.  They are not able to be used inside of a hard case either for the same reason.  Also, there is no hole for the center button.  Terrible design, do not buy.
B004Y0R9DI	This screen protector is great so far!  It is easy to install, and does not effect the resolution of the phone, which was the most important factor for me.By the way this is a review for the iphone 5 clear version.  It appears there are different reviews mixed in with this product, some from iphone 4's and some with the tinted screen protector.I can say that the clear version of this DOES NOT effect the screen clarity of my iphone 5!Speaking long term, I'm not sure, it may peal off in a week.  But as for now it is great.  I gave it four stars because it did take me two of the screen protectors before I could get the bubbles out.  Even the second one has a tiny bubbble in the right hand top corner, but that is litterally the only place that you can tell the product is even on the phone.
B004Y0R9DI	After tried different screen protectors I found this one and it is amazing, it fits perfectly and it is really easy to apply, bubble free and price is really decent. I highly recommend this item.He probado diferentes protectores de pantalla para mi iPhone 4, la verdad no habia encontrado uno tan bueno como este, encaja perfectamente, es facil de aplicar, queda libre de burbujas y esta a un precio decente... Producto altamente recomendado!
B004Y0R9DI	This protector goes on smoothly and easily, and stays on. I put my case on and off everyday to dock my iPhone 5s and never had the screen protector lift at all. I hate finger prints on my phone so this does a great job at minimizing them. You lose the glossy look of the screen, but to me that is a small price to pay compared to finger prints all over the screen. I have had it on my phone for one month now. I had two other protectors before this one and in less than a week removed both of them because they started lifting with removing the case. One of these protectors was almost $30 recommended from the Verizon store! No need to spend so much money when this one works perfect!
B004Y0R9DI	Let me just give a quick summary of this review before you read my story: GET THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR! IT'S AWESOME!On my iPhone 4S I had been using the Power Support Matte Antiglare Screen protectors.I liked them, they worked great and I especially enjoyed the matte texture even though it hindered the clarity of the retina display.From personal experience, I've thought that the matte finish was much better with anti-fingerprint because it's harder to see those oily residues with matte finish.With the release of iPhone 5, I decided to try out this screen protector. At first I was skeptical because I didn't believe that a completely transparentscreen protector would be able to hide the fingerprints and oily stuff.When I received them and applied my first one, I was really disappointed because the screen was actually really sticky when I moved my thumbs around.It wasn't just the resistance of the surface but actually you could feel some stickiness. And with the stickiness came the oily residues visible on the screen. At first,I thought I applied the screen protector backwards but turns out not to be case and I applied it correctly.So the first hour I was really really disappointed and was about to write a review about how terrible this protector was.But as I kept using it after the first hour, I was very very pleasantly surprised. In a very short period of time, the stickiness went away and it wasvery nice to touch and swipe my fingers around. Even before caring about whether it was anti-fingerprint I was relieved that it was a decent protector at leastand I didn't completely waste my money.As I use it longer and longer (it's been about 3 weeks now) I am beginning to notice how AMAZING it is at not showing the oily residues or fingerprints.My screen stays completely clean all the time, I mean like SPOTLESS (under normal daily lighting). Of course the residues are there but only visible if you examine it very carefully with intense lighting.All in all, it does the best job of protecting the screen and being anti-fingerprint out of all the screen protectors that I have tried. I agree with one of thosereviews I've read on this product. I do agree that it is better than the Power Support screen protectors. On a minor note, the cutouts are good and fit nicely. I would highly recommend this product and I hope this review was helpful.
B004Y0R9DI	I got these because I wanted a matte finish screen protector for my new phone. I wasn't sure based on other reviews what these would actually be like, but overall I am pleased. The one thing I will point out is that it isn't exactly anti-fingerprint, but it does cut down on glare. (No fingerprints, they just smear.)
B004Y0R9DI	Great priced screen protectors that do what they should. I have to say I was not expecting the quality these screen protectors offer for the value. I have used more expensive screen protectors from well known manufacturers and have had issues such as covered sensors, poor fit, scratching easily, etc but after a week of use I can say I have had no issues with fit, peeling, scratching or sensor interference with these on my iPhone 5. These are Anti-Glare / Anti-Fingerprint screen protectors that work as they should, you do lose a little bit of clarity from the Retina display but that is to be expected from the texture of a AG/AF screen protector. I have a bit of experience applying screen protectors so I had no issues applying these. This pack includes 3 screen protectors a plastic squeegee style card a cleaning cloth a dust removal film and comes with detailed instructions along with a customer support phone number just in case.I do my screen protector installs in my steamed up bathroom to avoid dust in the air and I've had the best results this way. I basically clean my screen, peel the adhesive side of the screen protector off, hold it in one hand from the sides squeezing a little to flex the center down where the home button and front camera/speaker cut outs can be lined up. When lined up I let it down slowly making sure the sides are aligned as it comes down then I use my thumbs to smooth it out and push any bubbles that may have formed out.If for any reason you get dust under when installing you can use scotch tap on the closest corner to pull up the protector part way and another piece of scotch tape to stick under the protector to get the dust particle out then lay the protector back down and push out the bubbles again. Repeat as needed.
B004Y0R9DI	Same quality as moshi but with a lot less money and you have three when they get scratched excellent price
B004Y0R9DI	This product provides good protection for the iPhone 4 and fits well.  Although I can't say it was easy to apply I can say it wasn't any harder than other screen protectors.  I thought the directions about lifting the protector once it was on and using tape to remove trapped dust was handy.  The suggestion really worked.  It also comes with a sticky sheet that can be used instead of tape.  The Generiks is a good product at a good price.
B004Y0R9DI	The application was easy, it looks great on my phone, and it has stayed on without sliding off when removing my case.
B004Y0R9DI	I purchased the generiks screen protector.  There are 2 paper tabs glued to the screen protector.  One on the front and one on the back.  When I removed them the glue stuck to the screen so I had to put a blemished screen on my phone.  The price is cheap but I would not recommend this product.
B004Y0R9DI	Purchased for my husband, works well and very protective and easy to use.  Would recommend.  I do not have any dislikes.
B004Y0R9DI	Good product and price. Delivered on time.  Glare is much better but not gone entirely when I am outdoors on very sunny day.  Easy to install- one bubble I couldn't get rid of.
B004Y0R9DI	Item as described and not too challenging to put on. No weird feeling on screen and button pushes still register fine. Thanks!
B004Y0R9DI	i would totally buy these again.  i was converting from an otterbox to a bumper and wanted a good screen protector.  i'm still on the same protector a few months later (and i don't have the best track record these things, so that's good for me), and i dunno, i just love the matte finish.  if you want a shiny screen protector you won't like this.  If you're looking for something to take the glossiness off but not the style, then you'll like this.
B004Y0R9DI	These anti-glare protectors add a prism effect on the screen to make it anti-glare.  It makes reading on my phone more difficult than without any film on it.  I will have to order the glare free screen protector to replace these.On the plus side, it does seem to attract less dust than having no screen protector on the phone.  So, less dust and smudges than no protector but distortion on the image similar to a matte finish photo versus a glossy finish.
B004Y0R9DI	I wanted a cheap screen protector that would do the job and this is exactly that.  It's been on my phone for about 2 weeks now and I don't notice it at all.  My phone gets thrown in my purse with my keys and whatnot but there aren't any scratches on the screen, so it works well.  Went on pretty easy, I'm awful at these kinds of things, there are one or two TINY air bubbles on the edge that I'm sure are my fault but I don't really notice them much. Overall, good product for the right price.
B004Y0R9DI	I purchased the Generiks screen protector in Anti-Glare finish for my iPhone 5.  I had just upgraded from an iPhone 3GS that I had for 3 years, onto which I affixed a Power Support Screen Protector back when Apple was selling them directly.  That lasted without any issues.  The Generiks protector is of a quality that is on part with the Power Support.  I wasn't as perfect this time and got a spot of dust underneath the protector, after cleaning out several other specs.  But it is barely noticeable.  The feel is great and allows for my finger to swipe across the screen without any effort.  The best compliment was after I handed the phone to a friend to play with, and after a minute or so I complained to him that I wasn't perfect in laying down the protector.  He didn't even notice it was there!
B004Y0R9DI	Comes with 3 front protectors, micro fiber cloth, tape, and squeegee.Pros: Well packed, fitted the Iphone 5 very well, good pricingCons: None
B004Y0R9DI	I recommend this product for sure to my friends. It's worth for the money rather than spending 25$ at best buy.
B004Y0R9DI	This screen protector is probably one the best screen protectors I have ever used on a my iPhone. It is easy to apply and includes everything that there is to include to apply. I received these for free so I could review them, however for the price they are sold at AND it includes 3 of them ... you can't go wrong. I highly recommend using the includes tape dust catcher as it picks up the particles that are hard for the human eye to see. It looks nice and doesn't seem to scratch as much as the others. I started to put my keys in the same pocket as the phone, and I can barely see any scuffing. If you are in the market for screen protectors, these are the ones to go for.
B004Y0R9DI	I like this screen protector. It fits perfectly to my iphone 5c and doesn't have any bubbles after installation as those other screen protectors despite the fact that I am not an expert installing the screen protector on the phone. Installation was easy and quick, no thing messy, no bubble (as mentioned). The screen protector is well made and not that flimsy as many others. Good purchase that would save the budget I would say. I recommend this product.
B004Y0R9DI	good product. attached at first try without any bubbles(do not forget to clean your screen),it was like a breeze to put on. great screen protector!
B004Y0R9DI	I was completely surprise with how amazing this screen protector was!! There were absolutely no bubbles and it fit perfectly! Definitely will buy from again/recommend!
B004Y0R9DI	maybe I imagined something different, but when I bought this thinking anti-fingerprint, I expected that I wouldn't see any fingerprints or smears on it.. BUT No, its just the same as any other screen. same prints, same smears. The only plus is that the screen is larger so it does seem to cover almost edge to edge, compared to other screens. Its still not completely edge to edge, but close.bummed its not anti-fingerprint. :(
B004Y0R9DI	Having used a few other screen protectors in the past, I was not expecting much at this low price. Wow, was I surprised. These are terrific! No bubbling, no smudging, not even fingerprint marks left after use.
B004Y0R9DI	I used this product on my old iPhone 4, and decided to buy its iPhone 5s version for my 5s, and it turns out my decision is wise.The protector is anti-glare. It reduces the direct reflection of external light. Effectively, with the protector on the screen, you will not see sharp reflection image of environmental light sources, making contents in the screen stand out more.I have used many anti-glare protectors before, with price ranging from $5 to $20. They all have flaws: expensive ones may be difficult to apply, while the cheap ones may have &#34;rainbow&#34; or &#34;color grains&#34; problem. Note that usually anti-glare films consists of numerous tiny transparent grains which create random reflection light, and they tend to create interference pattern (rainbow or random point-like color distortion).This product is different. There is absolutely no interference pattern. Moreover, the film surface eliminates the stickiness from finger sweat, which is highly annoying when using a naked iPhone screen. It just feels good. You will be surprised that with &#60;$3, you can have 3 such high quality protector to play with.I recommend all of you to try out this product.
B004Y0R9DI	Easy to install with absolutely no bubbles. Product worked as described. I will purchase again if needed. Thank you very much.
B004Y0R9DI	The screen protector was easy to apply, though I did bend one corner slightly thinking there was a top film on the protector (there was not). Love the anti-glare property and the fact that fingerprints do not show up easily. I also have this brand of Screen Protector on my Kindle Fire and am quite happy with that one too!Bottom line: great product, works as advertised, would buy again
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors are easy to apply and stay on.  Received this product as a free sample, and was very pleased with the quality.
B004Y0R9DI	I tried using this film on my new iPhone 5, and found it was not responsive at all, so I removed it.
B004Y0R9DI	After not being able to get as much money as I wanted for my iPhone4 due to scratches on the screen, I decided to invest in a screen protector this go-round. I went with the anti-fingerprint/anti-glare version, since those were important to me. So far, I have installed one on my phone, and one on my stepfather's, and will probably install the third on my mother's new iPhone5. It does take a couple of minutes to install, but went pretty smoothly, and I haven't had any issues with the edges lifting, etc. Every once in a while, there is an issue with the screen not reacting to my finger, but I think the protection definitely outweighs the rare annoyance. Most of the time I forget it's even there. For the price, I would definitely recommend this product.
B004Y0R9DI	works as expected.  easy to apply and openings fit well.  leaves just enough room around the edges so that you don't have to have it on perfectly.
B004Y0R9DI	Great price for this item!!  Fit the phone well.  Easy to apply! If I run out of the screen protectors will for sure buy these again.
B004Y0R9DI	I have used these types of screen protectors for all of my devices. I like the clarity of the screen(doesn't look like I even have a screen protector on it). I have seen the screen protectors that use a spray to adhere them and have a lifetime guarantee and to me, they distort the screen and cost more. The best way to put them on is to have a piece of tape wrapped around a finger sticky side out, start on one end, slowly lay the protector on the screen. If you see a bubble due to a tiny piece of lint, back it up and use tape to grab it. Use the card that came with and squeeze out any air bubbles.
B004Y0R9DI	Fit my Verizon iPhone 5 perfectly. Easy to install. Only three bubbles after first laying down the protector. The bubbles came out easily with the &#34;scraper&#34; tool provided. Protects my screen from my keys, etc in my purse.
B004Y0R9DI	Just bought a pack for my new iPhone 5. I've been using Power Support for my iPhone 4/4s for a long time. When I got my iPhone 5 Power Support has not released theirs, so I ordered this pack here instead. And now I'm a very happy customer. As you apply it on the iPhone, the texture, thickness, fineness all feel 95% like the Power Support film. But look at the price! You get a pack of 3 for a lower cost than one piece of Power Support film!  Although I ordered it to Hong kong, the price including the shipping fee together still make it a better choice than Power Support. Well done Generiks!
B004Y0R9DI	The Generiks screen protector film for iPhone 5 comes in a pack of three along with clear instructions and a sheet of lint tape. The films have a stiff front sheet that has a frame around the screen portion of the glass, which makes them very easy to apply. It is best to start at the bottom and move up. The initial application went easily and there are no visible bubbles.This particular film has no sticky adhesive and can be removed, washed, and reapplied if necessary. It clings in place and when removed, leaves no residue. This comes in handy if lint is seen underneath and it doesn't attract so much dirt around the edges.This film does do a good job of protecting the glass from scratches. It allows the fingers to glide easily across the screen and it reduces the appearance of fingerprints and smudges. It does give the screen a slightly matte finish but doesn't interfere with the touch sensitivity or even the fingerprint recognition and it minimizes glare.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review. These protective films are as good as any I've tried and I can easily recommend them. I don't consider price in my evaluation but they are a good value at this time, as well.
B004Y0R9DI	The screen protector did not last very long, maybe four or five months. The application and instructions were good. MEH
B004Y0R9DI	tech armour would come off after a short while.. i am thinking it is thicker and more stiff..this one stays on and works great..
B004Y0R9DI	I love these protectors! It really dampens the usual glare to almost nonexistence and they don't show the grease caused by fingerprints or from my face after calling people. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 only because of the slight color dampening it causes, but I think that's pretty unavoidable for this type of protector. Will definitely buy more of these. I'm already on the third one because I messed up the application of the first one (I wasn't careful) and I scratched the second one when I dropped my phone (it hit something sharp, the protectors are pretty strong).
B004Y0R9DI	So, what's nice about this matte covers is that they are inexpensive and you get three of them.  I put one on today and it went on really nice and easy, worked a few air bubbles out and now it looks top notch.  With the glossy glass and lighter weight of the iPhone 5 I was worried it was just going to drop out of my hand, so the ever so slight texture from these covers is great.  Plus, while there is a slight blurring, there is no rainbow effect.What is less nice is that they still haven't got their cutter quite lined up right.  I got the sides and covers of the cover spot on.  The home button cut out is just a hair off center, but the ear piece / camera cut out is way more off kilter.  Doesn't bother me too much, it's already wonky because of the proximity sensor, but if you're a perfectionist then this is probably not the cover for you.
B004Y0R9DI	I prefer these hard clear protectors over the floppy film protectors.Gotta keep the new iPhone 5 in good shape
B004Y0R9DI	A great screen protector.  I can't even tell I have it on my phone. It is a little tricky to put on; you just have to make sure you put it on the phone first and then pull of the second layer.  Love it!
B004Y0R9DI	I have been buying from Generiks for all my screen protector needs. The film is easy to install and protects my phone from finger prints. Additionally, the film is extremely easy to clean and comes in batches of 3. Perfection entirely!!!
B004Y0R9DI	This shield is AWESOME. It's so much better smoother than the Zagg shields. I wish it came with a back shield though!
B004Y0R9DI	They are somewhat difficult to apply, but with the cloth and whiper it was a lot easier. I like it and ive had it for a few months and dont need to replace it yet.
B004Y0R9DI	Came so fast and with all the supplies I needed to make it fit perfectly! No air bubbles, completely smooth. I would def order again
B004Y0R9DI	good quality screen protector comes with card to squeeze out bubbles, stick sheet to remove dirt and microfiber cloth. got it in first one itself
B004Y0R9DI	They changed the design a little bit since I first got them but when I first bought them it was before the iphone5 was released.  These work well.
B004Y0R9DI	This product is great.  I have had it for a couple months and the cases offers great protection as well as a sleek look.  It also maintains the phone's light weight.  I would highly recommend this product.  The company's customer service is also fantastic and they sent me free screen covers.
B004Y0R9DI	I was looking for a protective film like the i-Blason one that I have on my iPad mini that has the sticky area only on the black outer edges and not the screen area which makes installation bubble free. Unfortunately i-Blason no longer makes film for the 4S, so Generiks was the only one I could find with the same type of bubble free film. I took 2 stars off, 1 because the film is too glossy and doesn't reduce reflection and finger prints like the i-Blason matted film and 1 star because the instructions said to clean the screen with the &#34;included&#34; cloth, however no cloth was in the package.Bottom line: if you have an iPhone 5 or 5S (or iPad) go with the i-Blason. I've had it on my iPad mini for over a year and it's as good as the first day I put it on and it reduces glare and finger prints better. I also wonder about how long this Generiks film will last given the cheap packaging and missing cleaning cloth. But if you have an iPhone 4 or 4S this is your only option for a bubble free film.
B004Y0R9DI	I ordered the clear protectors for my iPhone 5, what arrived was too wide and had no cut out for the home button. Just fyi, the iPhone 4,4S, and 5 are negligibly different in width, but the protector was the height of the 5 so that was not the issue. In no way did I receive what is pictured or described. I only ordered these to hold me off until my Photive Shield screen protectors were back in stock(https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/order-history/ref=ohs_order_orderid?ie=UTF8&hasWorkingJavascript=1&opt=ab&qid=&search=103-3830549-6266651&sr=), which I highly recommend - 5 stars from a clear(difficult to see sometimes) and similar tactile feeling to the actual screen. In any case, Amazon returns are great and easy to work with, so that was a swift and easy return, despite the waste of time.
B004Y0R9DI	I was looking for a standard anti-glare screen protector at a fair price, this is exactly what I received. Out of the dozens I have tried, this one was no different (quality wise), and functioned equally as well as the $15-20 ones that any Best Buy or cellphone carriers' sell.The case I have made the edges bubble a bit, so in attempts to make it stay I continually worked the edge down using a variety of objects, I was surprised to find out that the screen was in fact scratch proof! +1!!Worth every penny. I'd buy more.
B004Y0R9DI	I see no difference between these Generiks and the more expensive screen protectors I've used. Except the low price! I messed up the first one, then successfully installed the other 2 on my iPhone and my husbands. The true test is if the edges cling to the screen. These do on both phones. I will definitely buy this product again when I need to replace these. At this price, you can't lose - even if you leave a few tiny dust specks.
B004Y0R9DI	This fits the phone well and it also helps protect the screen from any minor scratches.  It works very well.
B004Y0R9DI	Protects my screen real good. And when I mean real good, I mean really really good. And when I mean really really good, I mean really really really good.
B004Y0R9DI	I was excited to see such a good deal on iPhone 5 covers so soon after the phone launch. Furthermore, it carried a very respectable average rating on Amazon so I ordered without hesitation. Unfortunately, the product I received was terrible.The outer package was exactly as pictured on the item page. It was even labeled as iPhone 5 screen protector 3-pack. What was inside the package was entirely the wrong thing, however. There were three screen protectors, but they were the wrong size. The width and rounded corners fit the phone well, however there were no cutouts for the speaker, camera, light sensor, or home button. Even if there were a home button cutout, the cover was not long enough to reach the button.I don't know what I was shipped, but it wasn't an iPhone 5 cover. At least not one that I'd ever use.
B004Y0R9DI	These screen protectors have been the easiest I've ever owned when it came to install them. They went on quick without a single bubble. However, I wanted the "clear" screen protectors and thought that is what I was receiving when looking at the reviews when I was purchasing them. Somehow I ended up inadvertently ordering the anti-glare ones (which seem to be the same as the anti-fingerprint ones), so that is what I will review. The quality of the image is noticeably lower and darker. The glare in sunlight isn't quite as bad as a naked phone, but it is still there. Coupling that with the darkness of the screen makes it more difficult to see the screen now in sunlight than with nothing on the phone. I wish I had the clear screen protectors because these genuinely seem well made and durable; it is very difficult to scratch inadvertently. However, as an "anti-glare" product, these fail and make the retina display of the 4S extremely murky.I really wish I had clear ones :'(
B004Y0R9DI	Just had some difficulty applying the screen protectors but that may very well be user error and probably is user error
B004Y0R9DI	Cheap, easy and simple to place on your iphone 5. I placed it 2 months ago and still no bubbles or reduced transparency....
B004Y0R9DI	fairly good screen protectors for the price. I don't notice the anit-glare that they are advertised as, but they are pretty good at being "fingerprint resistant". Of course if your hands are greasy or dirty it will leave a smudge but that's unavoidable :P
B004Y0R9DI	This is one of the easiest screen protectors to install that I tried on my phone.  It is also a bit thicker.  My first try is free of bubbles so I still have two more screen protectors for spare.  It came with a one-page manual that is easy to follow.  It was shipped with very minimal packaging.My only gripe is the cutout on the ear speaker,it looks a bit too big and not exactly aligned.Overall, it is a great value if you need very decent screen protectors for your iPhone.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.
B004Y0R9DI	I just saw the review saying this item is better than PowerSupport.This is completely wrong.The cutout is too large and looks terrible. I just put it on 5 minutes ago and am not pleased at all.Why is the cutout twice the size of the speaker???I have tried every other AG SP since PowerSupport won't have any until "late October" and NONE can compare.PowerSupport is the absolute BEST AG SP hands down.I will wait until they are FINALLY on sale.Anything but PowerSupport just doesn't compare. I've tried so many brands now for iPhone 5 that its getting rediculous and makes it obvious to me that I will not find anything better than PS.
B004Y0R9DI	The product is great and very easy to use.  I have used other screen protectors but this one was easiest to install.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the screen protector gets finger print marks on it and you can see a glare, but still the best one I have used.
B004Y0R9DI	Although it doesn't cost much it is a really good product, I am very satisfied with it. Does the job and it was easy to install.
B004Y0R9DI	I love these screen protectors. They are very easy to apply and reduce glare. I highly recommend these. Great value, too!
B004Y0R9DI	Best ever used. Love the texture and easy application. No bubbles. Love extra sticky to remove dirt. Fast shipping. Will buy again.
B004Y0R9DI	Don't understand why there are so many negative reviews.  Do a good job of cleaning the screen and follow the directions.  Had it on for about a week and still as good as day one.  Will definitely buy again.
B004Y0R9DI	I was pleasantly surprised. There are plenty of screen protectors out there that are way more expensive. This is a good quality protector, applied easily and does the job all for a few bucks.
B004Y0R9DI	I can recommend anyone to buy, it is really very good and the price is very inexpensive. I got it earlier than it supposed to arrive
B004Y0R9DI	These protective films are every bit as good as the overly pricey PowerSupport films sold by Apple. Like all protective screen films, you need a static-free environment and, preferably, a compressed air canister to blow away any bits of dust or lint that are stuck to your screen. The adhesive sticker helps take off any remaining fuzzies.A credit card helps smooth out any bubbles. It helps to use a length-wise technique using the home button and he edge behind it as a guide for setting the film, while slowly letting the film continue to drop up into the earpiece.Don't spend any extra time wondering if you should buy any other films. These are an unbelievably good deal and are high quality. My iPhone 5 looks like it's ready for a commercial shoot, especially with the translucent TechArmor TPU case that's also sold by Amazon.
B004Y0R9DI	You can't beat the price (3 in the pack), and the installation and performance are excellent.  The only problem I have with the product is that it is marginally smaller than the actual screen size.  This may not be a problem for those who use a phone case that doesn't come over the face of the phone, or for those who use a really big case that covers a good portion of the face.  But for me, there remains a space between my case's bezel and the screen protector.  The result is the perfect grunge groove:  a place where lots of gunk accumulates. There's probably a good reason they make these just short of actual screen size, but for me it's a bit of a bummer. Still, this is an excellent product at an excellent price.
B004Y0R9DI	after reading the reviews on here i chose to purchase the anti-glare and clear versions of these. I can't complain on the quality or the functionality of these editions. we replaced a version sold at the verizon store with this version and couldn't be happier... actually, this one applied with one tiny bubble where as the verizon sold one had a few huge bubbles and eventually fell off after a month. I will purchase again.
B004Y0R9DI	I used to pay 3-4 times what I paid for these, for seemingly the identical product.  I bought the 3-pack and installed them on my iPhone 4S, my wife's 4 and my son's 4.  All three fit perfectly and were easy to apply without bubbles.  The key is they provide a sheet of some sort of low-stick tape to apply to the face of the iPhone after you clean it and just before you apply the screen protectors.  It's the best way to get rid of those pesky dust particles that always seem to land on the screen right before you apply the protector.  I will definitely buy these again when the time comes.
B004Y0R9DI	The item got here pretty quick but it was misleading!  The screen protectors were the wrong size and they did not have the proper cut-out to fit the iphone 5!
B004Y0R9DI	Both my brother and I put these on our iPhones. They are easy to apply, fit perfectly and the clear screen feels very smooth and does not dim the light from the screen at all. Only complaint would be that the corners are hard to get stuck down - there is a small air bubble in both of ours near the top left corner but not on the actual screen, so really a very minor issue. Would highlyyy recommend these and would buy again!
B004Y0R9DI	The product did not work for me. I cleaned the face of my Iphone then I when by the directions exactly. It was no trouble alineing the film to the phone but I was unable to remove the bubbles created during application.  I tried different methods of applying the film and used the small white card supplied to no avail. The product appears to be a quality item so I must assume my application skills are lacking.
B004Y0R9DI	Put it on my phone and I noticed the difference in the reflection off the screen ... pretty simple to put on and I managed without the air bubbles. And the best part - its a 3-pack .. should  last till you get a new phone. .
B004Y0R9DI	After trying many screen protectors that left behind "bubbles" from application, these look fantastic.  They are slightly thicker than the average screen protectors and therefore seem more secure than other products I have tried.
B004Y0R9DI	This item came with great instructions, and I really like the packaging and the fact that it comes with 3 is awesome! I was able to apply my screen protector very easily. I also really like screen protectors like these because it looks like the screen itself, I'm not into the matte screen protectors or the ones that are silicone/gel type. This one is really smooth and feels like your actual iPhone screen. Great product! :)
B004Y0R9DI	This screen protector is a great product.  I have used the name brand version for years and loved it, but this is a much better value and works just as well.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to apply and remove screen protector.
B004Y0R9DI	If you have put screen protectors on the phones before then this one should be very easy to install. The quality seems good. If you do get dust trapped underneath then lift it up with a piece of scotch tape and insert another piece of scotch tape to stick the dust particles.
B004Y0R9DI	It's obviously cheap. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for a quality screen protector that can be applied without bubbles, you should probably pass this one by. If you are looking for a cheap screen protector, and you aren't really that perfectionistic, it does the job. I sort of expected this would be the case, and as I'm hardly perfectionistic about my screen protectors, it worked out great for me.
B004Y0R9DI	For the price, there are really none better.  Not TOO mat-finished to make the screen blurry. They are just right!
B004Y0R9DI	The matte finish is really good. it fit correctly on my new iPhone 5. I have been using this for 5 months now and its really good. I was able to place it on my first attempt itself. I have never put a screen film before so its really simple.
B004Y0R9DI	This screen protector has the best bang for your buck. I am always a little worried when applying my skin protectors because of bubbles that may pop up. This screen protector basically installed itself. All I had to do was set it down properly and it went on bubble free. I was amazed. I would recommend this product 100%!!
B004Y0R9DI	These are perfect for my iphone 5! The process to put it onto the screen can be very difficult especially if you want to avoid the bubbles! anyway, it was simple and easy I would deff. recommend these to everyone!
B004Y0R9DI	My iphone5 has no bubbles and no dust. The protector is just awesome. No glare and no finger print. It's as smooth as silk...Woow
B004Y0R9DI	Not much to sayIt worked the way it should and I don't really have any complaintsit's nothing special
B004Y0R9DI	Having been through multiple generations of iPhones and multiple multiple generations of screen protectors, I've since learned that paying $20+ dollars for one is pure madness.  However, the cheaper ones i've never been totally happy with either...either the feel or the distortion or they come off after a bit.  But I think i've found the holy grail here - Generiks clear (NOT MATTE)  Looks like the iPhone glass, is crystal clear with no distortion or loss of resolution, has a cool 3 layer installation system (remove one layer to expose adhesive side, remove the top layer after you've pushed all the bubbles out - voila the middle layer is smooth and solid as can be), and has the perfect sized holes to accomodate the mic, camera and home button.  Best of all is the feel - most screens i've tried feel odd and take some getting used to - these ones I notice zero difference between the clear plastic and the glass.  It's great!  AND, oh yeah,  I paid less than 2 bucks a screen.  Honestly i never write reviews, but I'm very very happy with Generiks.  Serious, tell the dealer tryin' to get you to drop a 20 on a Zagg to go stuff it - and buy a pack of these instead.  A+++
B004Y0R9DI	I bought both the clear and the anti-glare anti-fingerprint screens for iphone 5. I love them both! They were very easy to install, the cut outs are perfect and you've got to love the price! These are definitely comparable to the much more expensive screens and it's great that you get a pack of 3 so if you need to change out the screen it's no problem! Great product!!
B004Y0R9DI	I love the fingerprint-free quality, and while you can still see some finger swipes, it's nowhere near as noticeable as on the glossy ones.  I like the feel of it better, too, and I think it's easier to use the touchscreen without the glossy resistance.  Plus I think it's easier to see the screen without the glare.  Totally works, no more or less easy to put on than any other screen protector, and way cheaper.  Would definitely recommend.
B004Y0R9DI	I like it and suggest others. Being honest. Everything is good and great customer service. Thanks for the company and the girl who helped me. The product itself is nice. As described by seller.No cons, only PROS . Thumbs up!!!
B004Y0R9DI	I ordered this to try out the diamond screen protectors, I've already experienced the anti fingerprint from this company, so I figured why not try the others in a package deal. I'm used to clear from previous ones, so I haven't tried that one yet, anti glare I don't plan on using unless I don't have any left. The diamond I must say shocked me, it went on fairly easy like the anti fingerprint bubble free. But unlike the anti fingerprint it does hold fingerprints but is easy to wipe off. The diamond give it this glossy finish with specks of metallic in it, and it dosen't effect the retina display. So I'll recommend if you are looking to try out something new.
B004Y0R9DI	Best screen protector available. Clear screen and precise cutout. This my second time buying from Generiks. Also at a very great price!
B004Y0R9DI	This product works so well and is easy to apply. I love the matte finish. Will definitely purchase again once I've used the first 3.
B004Y0R9DI	This was as difficult as all screen protectors are to put on - so no surprises there. But I managed to secure it without bubbles and it's holding up well, months later.
B004Y0R9DI	Although it is relatively cheap, the quality of the product is extremely poor. Once you install the protector, it is quite difficult to get red of the air bubbles. It started peeling off shortly after I applied it. And finally I had to replace it only three months after I bought it. I really miss my old screen protector :(
B004Y0R9DI	I really like these...easy to apply and does take away glare. Not sticky or weird to the touch. Thanks very much.
B004Y0R9DI	It's okay because it works but it doesn't show the retina at its best. It has a grainy feel and look which takes away from the screen image.
B004Y0R9DI	The screen covers arrived very quickly and in good condition. The anti glare screens works great on my phone and is a big improvement.
B004Y0R9DI	These screens got very greasy no matter how clean my hands or how many times I cleaned the screen off.  Did not like them at all.
B004Y0R9DI	These are wonderful screen protectors. They go on easily, look great and have no bubbles. Will purchase again when needed.
B004Y0R9DI	This are by far one of the best dry protectors out there nice, easy to install no bubles really great product.
B004Y0R9DI	Very Good product. Had no trouble with it at all and have not needed to replace it yet. Will be purchasing from this company in the future.
B004Y0R9DI	I've tried 2 other screen protectors prior to this one.I found that this one is more "sticky" when applying. This means that to redo an application requires a little more effort to peel the protector off. It also means that if there is ANY dust on the screen while putting it on, the dust will cling even greater to the backside of the protector, making it harder to get off. (The key is to get all the dust off and work in as dust-free an environment as possible)I like the tactile smoothness of this protector. It seems to have a similar degree of anti-fingerprint surface level as my previous protectors.The place where I would detract some stars is in the quality of viewing. I find that this protector has a more matte finish than my other experiences, meaning that the image is softer.While it is fairly thick and durable and rigid, my preference is to opt for something lighter, that would allow me a better viewing experience.
B004Y0R9DI	I have no complaints with this product, I love it! A very good deal for the price! After reading reviews I wasn't sure about the cut outs but it turns out that they are better than the protector that came with the otterbox! Yes there was a couple of really small bubbles that were left on my screen but that is to be expected with self installation...anyways! great product! thank you and I will defiantley recommend.
B004Y0R9DI	Arrived on time.  Just followed the instructions - fit well.  Works really well - hardly any glare/reflection, no fingerprints.  Love the touch.  Though it's matte finish, it's not as coarse as you would imagine - quite smooth.
B004Y0R9DI	This item was very inexpensive and is extremely functional. It fits my iPhone 5 screen, was easy to apply, and looks clean.
B004Y0R9DI	Just what I thought. I used a left over rubber squeegee to reduce bubbles. Works with finger sensor on 5s phone.
B004Y0R9DI	This screen protector is excellent and is extremely clear and barely noticeable. Everything aligns perfectly and at this price, it is surely a steal. There is seriously no need to purchase a more expensive screen protector.
B004Y0R9DI	Screen protector was easy to put on with no bubbles. The matte/anti-glare ones enhance screen view-ability under light and cuts down on finger print smudging.
B004Y0R9DI	Just another cheap film. Not anti-finger print nor hard coated as advertised. I'm pretty careful with it but don't know how it scratched up on the third day but I got 2 more to spare. May need to change it once a month.Pro:Cheapfits wellCon:Not anti-finger printEasily scratchedJust got one bubble on the edge that I'm unable to removeI dont like too much unprotected space between the front camera and speak.
B004Y0R9DI	The screen protector is better than most. I really liked the way it looks and the application of it. Great value as well.
B004Y0R9DI	It's a decent screen protector for the price and u get 3 of them. It's easy to put on and it gives the protection as needed.
B004Y0R9DI	I had one of these for my 4s that I paid $30 for at the AT&T store and loved it, and these are for all intents and purposes, identical. Except you get 3 for 1/3 of the price. Very easy to install, completely bubble free (by design, not from quality of installation). It does take a bit of time to get adjusted to the new screen texture, and it does give somewhat of an "orange peel" effect but that is because of the anti glare properties it has. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish it was a little clearer, but I don't think that's possible in an anti glare screen protector of this type. All in all, very happy with my purchase.
B004Y0R9DI	These are nice screen protectors. They are well worth the price. i like that they have a clear glossy finish not the dull finish. it makes the colors very vibrant. They do not fully reduce glare, nor are they fully finger print free. But they do a fair job of the reduction of both. The protector is somewhat sticky if your fingers are a bit moist.This do a nice job of protecting the phone. the install is easy with a fairly bubble free finish. I would buy these again.
B004Y0R9DI	Great screen protectors especially for the price.  They came in a great package and on time.  They work for the phone and are easy to apply.
B004Y0R9DI	Purchased these along with my iFrogz cocoon case and so far so good!  The anti-glare works great, I have already put a small scratch on the protector but that's better than it being on the phone.  The price is fantastic and I got them two days after I placed the order!  These are just as good, if not better, than the ones you would buy from Apple or your phone carrier store.
B004Y0R9DI	The product arrived on time and fit the description. Unfortunately, I have an iPhone 5 and not iPhone 4. That was a faulty mistake on my end. If I knew how to ship it back, I would. Great product overall.
B004Y0R9DI	I chose this rating because the product is good. The protectors are easy to apply to the phone, clear and all over great quality. The seller shipped them out quickly. The packaging was excellent. In addition, even after I had opened the package and applied one protector, I asked for a refund, due to a gift from my sister of an otterbox which had its own screen protector, thinking that I would never use the ones I had not used., I explained this to the seller, and they said that I did not have to return the protectors, and they would refund me the money, regardless! I would recommend this seller for all of the above reasons! % stars!!!  Victoria P.
B004Y0R9DI	The screen protector is excellent!! Had no trouble installing and applying the screen down. No air bubbles and easy to do!
B004Y0R9DI	Item was installed with ease, good fit and no bubbles. Installation was better than my last screen protector. Would recommend product to others.
B004Y0R9DI	Although the directions supplied with these screen protectors was of limited help, I was surprised that I was able to apply one on my first try without ruining it.  I would ascribe that to the fact that this is the thickest screen protector I've ever had the pleasure of applying.The plastic was stiff enough that the bubbles were relatively easy to smooth out after application.  The resulting surface is a smooth, matte finish that looks great, feels great to the touch, and leaves the screen just as responsive as it should be.  I would buy this brand again in a heartbeat.
B004Y0R9DI	I have purchased a million screen covers for my previous Iphones and BB but this was the easiest to install and cleanest. I don't like the fact that the home button cut is not round but open at the bottom but i guess for some of us it makes it easier to install and not have it come off if it is sticking out a little. My case protects the open part but overall is a good product and would recommend you to buy it.
B004Y0R9DI	I like these screen protectors because they are not terribly difficult to apply to my phone and they are relatively inexpensive, so if they do get scratched up or start lifting from the screen it isn't a big deal to replace the film!  It already protected my new iphone 5s from one near mishap.  (The film was nearly gouged through but not a mark on my phone!)  An inexpensive fix to just replace the film~
B004Y0R9DI	these are just as easy if not easier to apply, and the quality is exactly like more costly versions.  the phone is expensive enough, no point in spending more if you don't have to.
B004YKYB84	reduces the glare to a satisfactory standard, no like the most amazing thing ever but it did the job and protect the phone.
B004YKYB84	I thought these were easy enough to apply.  With the HTC Sensation, as you know, it has that concaved edge all around the screen.  So your primary challenge, aside from not getting fingerprints on it, will be to encase the edges seamlessly without bubbles.  I failed on my first attempt and finally got it my last one.  Which was a good thing as there are just the 2 of them and a little pricey.  However they are worth it for the protection they offer.  Zero signs of use on my actual screen after 6 months use!
B004YKYB84	This product is inexpensive, and great quality.  The "anti-glare" property of the protector may pixelize the screen a tiny bit, but it does not bother me at all.  Easy to apply, and strong.  Awesome.
B004YKYB84	Excellent product! Recieved order earlier than expected.Perfect fit and easy to apply. A little pricey but great protection for your phone. I highly recommend this item!!
B004YKYB84	Comes with a screen cloth and 2 finger covers that can be used while putting it on.Very good screen protective BUT I'm very bad at putting it on... when I got it on semi-perfectly (without any air bubbles) it worked well for a week.BUT after awhile some dust got into it from the top (might be because it was slightly above the screen itself) but nonetheless it was a nice screen protector.If only the screen protective was cheaper I would give this 5 stars...
B004YKYB84	I purchased this product only to find out they do not stay on the screen.  I placed one on my wife's HTC smartphone which is hardly  used and it didn't stay in place. Please don't waste your money on this product.
B004YKYB84	Everything looks ok for now!! but it just day one.. all i can say is:-nice feeling when using the display-easy to apply-no problem reading with the sun and color stay almost natural
B004YKYB84	I have lost track of how many phone screens I have recently purchased but this one is by far the best one yet!
B004YKYB84	There is a BIG difference between a "screen protector" and an anti-glare film. While ALL anti-glare film are by default a screen protector most screen protectors do not offer much if any anti-glare.  This is one of the few that really does!  It will make your phone much more readable in the sunlight.  All of these things are difficult to put on without creating air bubbles. You just have to be patience and do it slowly and carefully.For anti-glare, highly recommended!
B004YKYB84	This is the best screen protector that I have found for my Sensation 4G so far.  It blows away the ones that I have bought from the T-Mobile store because:1. They actually fit around the whole screen, the T-Mobile ones don't2. They are pretty scratch resistent3. They are anti-glare vs. the glossy reflective ones from T-MobileThe only con that I have is that I must order them online.  T-Mobile really needs to carry these in their stores.
B004YKYB84	Looked at all of them and made a decision to purchase based on price and reviews.  For $15.99, I wasn't going to feel that bad if they didn't work out.  Applying the protector was straight forward, they give you everything you need, but it's not a great fit.  I had to take out a razor to cut a corner.  The first one lasted 4 months.  It could have lasted longer, but I tried to fix it...oops. Thankfully, this package ships with 2 protectors.  I just installed the 2nd one.  This time, I didn't have to use a razor to trim, but the protector is just 1 to 2.5 milimeters to big, the edges go off the screen, because the HTC screen isn't flat at the edges.  Seems to me the better fit would be a little smaller so all the edges of the protector were stuck to the screen.  I do have a Casemate case, and the rubber from that covers all the edges except the top.
B004YKYB84	I'm glad this came with 2 packs because I kinda messed up the first one (my fault for not reading directions - wear the finger protectors!). But now that I have it on my phone, it looks great. Bubbles worked themselves out quickly. Touch screen still responds nicely. The color looks great! I'm very happy with this anti glare screen protector!
B004YKYB84	exactly what i paid for, good fit considering the screen curves up at the sides, very minimal bubbles that have smoothed out pretty well. get a case that covers the edges slightly so it doesn't peel up accidentally, it's the phone's fault not the protector.
B004YKYB84	This is my first review but I had to let others now about this item.. I bought the HTC Sensation and the only screen protector available at the time barely fit and was glossy..  I wanted and Anti-glare so I can see things a little better.  I bought two of the these items because I'm OCD when it comes to getting bubbles under the screen protector but this one was so easy to apply and fit so well, that I got it on the first try.  The colors pop out bright as ever and you wouldn't even know you had one on.  A must have!!!
B004YKYB84	Well I'm glad it came with 2 SPs because I totally botched the first one.  At least now I have a good technique.  It fits great but the only bad thing I noticed is that it makes the screen seem sparkly and look 'noisy', which reduces the overall quality of the display.  Otherwise great protector.
B004YKYB84	It arrived really fast!and I tried one and It perfectly worked,it does not fit a little bit but I can not see well without looking carefully.
B004YKYB84	these screen protectors work great they fit the whole scneen wich is hard to find and the do take the glare off not as much as everyone says but it dose take the edge off
B005973A9C	Works great. A little difficult to apply however. Why do I have to have twelve more words to complete this review.
B005973A9C	This was an excellent purchase. The screen protector works and was quite easy to apply. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B005FQU2T8	I have used this for over two months and it worked fine. why do i have to write twentty words for a good product review?
B005FQU2T8	This screen matte screen protector does a great job cutting down on glare and it doesn't hamper the touch screen at all.  In fact, it seems to make it easier to slide your finger across the screen, because there is less friction than on the (uncovered) screen itself.
B0060D124O	keeps my phone from any scratches or damage to screen love it love it love it love it love it
B0060D124O	Adhesive is bad and sticks to the cover making the cover really hard to get clean.  Definitely a dud, will not buy again.
B0060D124O	Got em and still on the first one and they're pretty good and is completely invisible and strong and nice.
B0060D124O	it works and its cheap. cant complain about it . took a second try to get it right. good thing theres 3 of them
B0060D124O	It does fit the Driod Bionic well but is made of cheap material, bubbles up and does not stay on very long.  Don't waste your money!
B0060D124O	I mean it's okay but the plastic cover is kinda cloudy...not clear like other screen protectors.  Then again, what do you expect for something so cheap.  It works!
B0060D124O	I'll either give it a 1 star or 5 star as it's just a screen protector.  It's easy to apply.  I'll give it a five stars because I got 3 covers for the price which is pretty darn good.
B0060D124O	I have attached the screen protector and it goes on well, the issue is that dirt gets under the screen and it starts to lift. I placed it on about two weeks ago and this is definately not a products I would purchase again.
B0060D124O	Protect screen great. still using first one applied! Never thought that something so thin would take the abuse that this thing has!
B0060D124O	Easy to Apply.. Works GREAT> if anyone complains about "glue" on the thing, they're not applying it correctly. Film comes with 3 layers.. you take off one layer, and lay it on your phone.. then once you get all the bubbles out, there is a little tab that you pull, and it appears you're pulling off the screen protector, but if you look closely, the protector is STILL ON THE PHONE... youre pulling off the other LAYER!  there is nothing attached to the layer that's SUPPOSED to stay on the phone, so therefore there CANNOT be any GLUE left over!  if you want extra protection, leave the other layer on (but there will be a small section in the corner where the glue will NOT come off completely.. when that one gets banged up, tear it off and u still have a nice protector underneath.  I love this product. I will def be ordering again.****UPDATE**** I've had this on my phone now for a few weeks, and still have not had it lift up in the corners or anything. there is 1 scratch mark on the protector, but hey that's what its for!
B0060D124O	Easy to put on, wipes clean easily. First one hasn't lifted, torn, or bubbled in a few weeks, so much better than any other brand I've tried so far.
B0060D124O	This item was purchased for covering one of my children cell devices. It works very well and does what it is advertise to do.
