B004C04PA0	This review is for the Dexim Docking Station with remote control for iPhone/iPod. I wanted to be able to dock my 4G iPod Touch to my old integrated stereo amp system that I have in my shop, this unit fit the bill perfectly. I can now crank up my MP3s, Podcasts, or Pandora Radio via WiFi through my old stereo system. Just plug the RCA phono plugs into an auxiliary input on your receiver, plug in the 120 volt power supply, and you're ready to rock! The remote works well in this 24' X 30' building as long as you don't stray too far to the sides. The remote can select a playlist, a particular song within a playlist, advance or go back to the next song, and control the volume. You do need to begin locally at the iPod by selecting music or Pandora Radio. Has the heft and feel of a well made product.
B004C04PA0	I use this dock almost everyday I love it. It was easy to install and its great to plug it in and it connected to my system
B004C04PA0	At the beginning I was very happy with this docking. It fulfilled all my expectations. Easy to install, worked fine with my Iphone 4, even good looking. The problem is, after 6 month it just stopped working. Nothing. Tried cleaning, reconnecting, other iPhones, iPods but nothing. It only charges now. I must say that now I have a very expensive charger!! Wrote to Dexim for support, but just a friendly answer 2 month ago, but nothing to really help me.
B004C04PA0	DO WHAT IT SAYS, just i know it works for jailbrocken iPod 2G using 2 apps from cydia, display out or tvouttuner, i tried a standard composite video cable from dynex  and you could see the blurry video on the HDTV, but this product does it job at 720p resolution, I watch justin.tv live shows. MADE FOR:IPHONE 4 16GB-32GB; IPHONE 3GS 16-32GB; IPHONE 4-8-16GB; AND ALL IPOD TOUCH GENERATION 1ST, 2nd, 3rd and 4rd,IOS 4.0 OR UPGRADED VERSION; iPod classic 120GB and 160GB and iPod nano.
B004C04PA0	I purchased this unit for use at a school, allowing the kids to play thier own playlists during sports prevents them from hearing 70's heavy metal. remote is a little inconsitant also unit would not interface with what looked like an older ipod, other than that works exceptionaly well, takes some getting used to remote functions but still pleased w purchase.
B004C04PA0	Does not display playlist with iOS > 4. If you have a TV like mine, it will not send a video signal and the TV will not even play the audio but just give the 'no signal' message. Only plays video. Does not play photos or anything else. Just videos. Also, remote does not control device very well. At $50, this is not worth the price!! I got an Apple TV instead for $99 and it works great with tons more functionality!!
B004C04PA0	bought this as a christmas gift and my GFs parents seemed to love it.  very user friendly with out the insane price of some other similar products on the market. Its great because it allows you to charge and shuffle through music via the remote.
B004C04PA0	couldn't get it to work right and had a nasty buzz. I sent it back. I would avoid it - not worth the $$.
B004C04PA0	This product is exactly what I was looking for without the expense of ordering it from Apple.  The docking station came with multiple adapters so that each device fits well.  I could not be happier with this product.
B004C04PA0	It works, the cables connect (though disconnect with some difficulty) with the stereo receiver.  The remote is too limited in terms of line of sight contact with the base, but again it basically works.Not bad, not great.
B004C04PA0	great item, the video out doesnt work, I have a 3GS, with 4.1, I had to install an app to be able to take the video out to my tv.
B004C04PA0	The friend I bought this for has been raving about how awesome it is for days now.  She can use it to pipe her music, videos or pictures into her TV or just play her music through her stereo.
B004C04PA0	Worked so so for about 4 months. Power supply just quit yesterday, I'll try customer support to see if they will send out a new one. Sound is not as good as the earphone jack. Probably better off just getting a 1/4" earphone to RCA and a usb charger. Sounds better and is much cheaper.
B004C04PA0	Very happy to buy this article. This is the best qualiy I have seen from other company. Very well made. Thanks
B004C04PA0	This device is really reasonably priced and works great!  I bought it just to have a stationary power docking station that my kids wouldn't take and lose all over the house, and it works perfectly for this.What's more, having the HDMI hookup into the TV/stereo system was just an added bonus.  So, last night we rented a movie from itunes and played it from the ipod into the TV and surround system, and it was really good.  The video is crisp and the sound is perfectly fine!  I think I can use it for Amazone Prime streaming too.Nice to have a remote too where I can pause the movie.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B004C04PA0	I was nervous about this dock but it exceeded expectation.  It connects fairly easily to your receiver and TV and also has a nice display through your TV. Be careful about leaving the display on however, to prevent burning in of your screen.  The remote is handy but is limited in range.  Also the AC adapter cable is short and I needed to use an small extension cord.
B004C04PA0	After reading all the reviews about the Dexim AV Docking Station I could hardly wait to receive my Dexim docking station. As luck has it I received a bad one. It was dead up on arrival. I though no problem, I will exchange it for another but after checking Amazon I discovered that they were out. I haven't returned the one I received yet because of my work schedule but plan to soon. I only wish I had received a working one so I could give it five stares too.
B004C04PA0	this device works wonderfully whit the iphone 4g, is very confortable to have one, and it has, very nice image conected to the tv, if you need to see all your stuf in a higer screen you most have this article.
B004QKLVIK	This is my third Power Duo. Love them!!  First one I bought off  EBay. Had the old style battery. It died within a month. This has the smaller battery. So far this one is doing great. It won't fully charge my Gen 4 Touch, but it will put it in the 70 % range. I have a RavPower RP-PB07 for a full charge. Also great item. Keeps my Touch from flashing the 20% warning constantly.Thank you Apple :(  I know my battery is almost dead!!  The battery itself is about the size of a Zippo lighter, It  Comes with a AC charger and one for the car, both have a USB port, so you can charge your Apple device while the battery charges. If you&#8217;re an Otterbox fan like me you will need a 30 pin extender for the charge port. Got the Cosmos for maybe $3, 00. Great little charger at a really great price. A+++
B004QKLVIK	When I put this into my 3% full cell, when the &#34;PowerDuo Reserve&#34; was fully charged, my cell phone only got about an extra 3-5% boost.
B004QKLVIK	The good: The battery is small and light.  The less then optimal: The battery pack does not provide much extra power.  Reviews for this product (on Amazon and elsewhere) report it provides about 70-75% additional battery life.  In 2 uses of this with my iPhone 4S, it only provided 15%-20% increase in battery power.  The 15% was after the battery pack had sat about a week after being charged.  The 20% was after the battery pack had been just removed from the charger and said it was fully charged.  While I like Griffin products and generally find them to be of better than average quality, I think this product is a bit too expensive for the additional power it provides.
B004QKLVIK	Have this product for over one year and liked it enough to send it as a gift for a friend!
B004QKLVIK	Item was just has described. It arrived just in time for christmas. My grandson was thrilled to get it. Satisfied.
B004QKLVIK	Power reserve duo works great with my iPhone 4S and even my iPod  it will fully charge my older iPod in 15 mins cause it's not a touch screen it's ancient lol.  And it will take my 4s from 20% to 85% in 45 mins if I'm not using the phone.
B004QKLVIK	Do not buy this product it is horrible!! It only has a little bit of power to add.  Maybe 5 or 10 mins if that!!! It takes a couple of hours to charge. This product is way over rated!!!
B004QKLVIK	This is the second griffin charger I have purchased. The first one was for my teenage daughter, who loves this device and carries it with her wherever her phone goes. The second was for my wife, who like my daughter, would find herself in an awkward place with a phone about to die. The backup battery charges from the car charger and is fairly small so it fits in a pocket or purse easily. It provides about a 40% charge, so don't expect a full charge. The 40% charge gives them both about 2 hours of phone service, so so far it fits the need very well without being bulky. Now my grown son wants one.
B004QKLVIK	Ok, I got this for our 4 hour flight and it came in handy when my daughter had 7 percent battery life and when she used this it gave her 37 percent more. Works fast and keeps it's charge even if it's not plugged in for a couple days.
B004QKLVIK	Already had one that we bought from a store an paid an arm an leg for. Had lost it so needed another one.
B004QKLVIK	This battery has been charged for hours and only provided me with 20% boost. Seems useful for trips and plus it comes with wall and car charger. Didn't pay much for it but $29.99 seems overpriced for me.
B006FYY5WY	loved this one, worked well with both mine and my husbands phones in the wall or in the car, even together because it had the extra usb spot, this one was broke because my husband mcguyvered a way to charge our cell phones with the power out.I bought a replacement but it wasn't the same company I bought this one from and the new one doesn't work for my anything, however it does work for my husbands.
B006FYY5WY	Have had this for 2 years and still works. It's awesome to have this charger, you get a wall charge, a car charger, and it has an extra USB port!
B006FYY5WY	Fantastique! Great and very compact and convenient. The best to me on the market. Very good product. I would highly recommend this item.
B006FYY5WY	I love this charger. It allows you to charge your phone in the car and, if necessary, in the house. I just purchased another as a back up. It has come in handy many times.
B006FYY5WY	This product was wonderful. It works like new and I got it over 50% off the shelf price!!!! I am very satisfied. It works for in the house and on the go in my car. Wonderful!
B0077RO08C	FAST CHARGING EVEN WITH MORE THAN ONE DEVICE BEING CHARGED. IT GOES ALMOST EVERY WHERE WITH ME. MONEY WELL SPENT. ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE SHAPE I FIND IT TOO BULKY. COULD BE SLIMMER. OVERALL I LOVE THIS DEVICE.
B0077RO08C	Broke immediately and having a lot of trouble getting it replaced.  A very good idea but poor execution.  Stay away.
B0077RO08C	The TyIt features a large 5,200mAh LiIon battery that can be used to charge other devices at 2.1A output, so it's good for smartphones as well as certain tablets like my new Lenovo Miix 2. A handy micro-USB output cable is built into the battery, so that's a major convenience.  You can use a regular USB cable to charge other devices.  I do not believe you can plug in two devices at the same time.The battery is not too heavy but it's quite bulky. I wish they had made it in a flatter shape for easier carrying.  The bulky shape makes it a little difficult to carry in a pocket, for instance.
B0077RO08C	I bought this because i work 12 hours a day and my phone would occasionally not make it the whole day. I have the Galaxy GS3 and it will fully charge it twice. The best part is that there is a mini usb cord built right into it no need for an extra cable.
B0077RO08C	It feels cheap, takes forever to charge a device, and the button broke on mine,.It will charge your phone, and holds a charge for at least a few weeks without discharging it.
B0077RO08C	I carry this around daily in my bag, and the built in charging cord is invaluable for me.Recommend without reservation
B0077RO08C	Honestly i really like this accessory and it does provide the battery juice it claims..Shape could ve been less of squarish but I can live with it[...]
B0077RO08C	I bought two of these and at first they were fantastic. Then, somehow, something in the charger arm broke (I've used it three times) and now it has to be finagled to work properly. Very unhappy.
B0077RO08C	I bought this battery pack for an upcoming trip to Ireland and wanted something portable to charge my phone and tablet on the go. I looked at every option, from solar power devices to packs similar to the Tylt, and ended up purchasing this on. So far, I definitely would recommend this product! (I have only used it once so I can't speak to it's rechargability of the battery pack itself) On the first run I brought it to a restaurant and it charged my cell phone in an hour (and I was using it at the same time).Other reviewers led me to believe the battery pack was very bulky, so maybe I was expecting something larger, but I am totally fine with the size of it. I just threw it in my purse. I had done a lot of research on other battery packs and where to buy them, and this was BY FAR the cheapest at $29.99 with free shipping. Plus, it was delivered in 4 days (6 days early!) which was an awesome perk.
B0077RO08C	Thanks will buy again !!!!!! My husband took mine over seas and he told me that it really helps him out a lot so VERY VERY VERY HAPPY CUST WILL BUY MORE!!!!
