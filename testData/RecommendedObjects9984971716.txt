9985719743	I had intitally purchased this for my Mifi but discontinued the Mifi so I never took it out of the package...until I purchased a new cell phone with Verizon. I was plesantly surprised that it worked for my phone too!! That saved me the money of purchasing one through Verizon(too expensive...they tried) and already having what I needed at home. I am very pleased with this purchase and seller!! Great great product at a great price!!
9985719743	A good value and he product is tops, handy and works good on several of my tablets as well as theVerizon MiFi jet pack
9985719743	Perfect for traveling with my Verizon MiFi wireless. Keeps the unit charged and allows me to use my laptop while traveling.
9985719743	Thankfully, this car charger fits our MiFi device, and we can now take it with us on trips so we can get online using our tablet.  We did test it in the car.
9985719743	I did receive my cord and it works great and at a great price.  I can use my hotspot while it is plugged in.WARNING: The one I ordered arrived in a package marked Motorola RAZR v9.  It appears the MiFi uses the same cord.
9985719743	I had tried standard micro-usb car chargers, and they would not recharge my Novatel Myfi card.  Tried this one, and it works.  Please with product so far.
9985719743	When charging with this device it doesn't allow use of the MiFi at the same time.  It will only charge.  When using a standard USB converter for a car outlet, you are able to charge and use the device at the same time.
9985719743	Great product, so far, no problems. Saved tons of mOney from not buying one at a Verizon storE. We will have to see its durability. But it's hard to beat the price.
B002AHFQP0	It's cheap for a reason. Thin wiring. even got a shock or two when I touched it while charging. But it works.
B002AHFQP0	a very great buy. also very reasonably priced. i would def suggest to anyone who needs one cause it is cheap
B002AHFQP0	After a trip to Verizon store, found out it was no longer available from them.  So glad I could get one from Amazon.  We have older phones and many vehicles.  Made it easy to have a charger in each vehicle. Now all the work vehicles and our personal ones have chargers.  Price was incredible.  1/10th of original.  We bought three of them.  Works as well as the one original we still have.
B002AHFQP0	This is the second one I've bought after losing the first.  I'll never buy a charger from the dealer again, since these work perfectly.
B002AHFQP0	Purchased this a while back and still using it. Working fine. The price was the best thing about this (inexpensive relative to other chargers or ones at retail or phone stores).
B002AHFQP0	My wife's phone is discontinued (Samsung Alias 2) but we were able to find a good used one on Amazon after hers met its doom in a cup of coffee.  This car charger was about $3 with shipping, the Verizon store wanted $20 IF they had it, so that is a great deal in my book.  Item took about a week to arrive, works flawlessly, we actually used it as the only charger for a few weeks until we found the wall charger, again on Amazon.  Love this site, especially for small electronics like this!
B003TMG9EC	Was concerned it would fit my car & thenew phone, but fits both & is extremely convenient to have in my car!
B003TMG9EC	I just purchased my second car charger like this--my first lasted almost 3 years!Amazon is the place for cheap phone accessories!!
B003TMG9EC	When it arrived i was a little skeptical, but it worked great in my car. Im glad i ordered 2!
B003TMG9EC	I have used it several times, no issues with it. It was a great value- definitely worth the price I paid for it.
B003TMG9EC	For the price, I thought this product might not be too good, but I'm pleased. No problems and it workd great.
B003TU3S5M	Can't complain for the price. Does exactly what it was intended to do. I suspect that it will hold up quite well over time.
B003TU3S5M	This device does what it is supposed to do.  Plug it in, the charge light goes on and that's it.
B003TU3S5M	I had to force it down in order for the phone to actually charge. The second I take my hand off of the charger the light goes out and it wont charge.
B003TU3S5M	The good:Charges my Samsung Droid Charge quickly, and even charges when phone is used as GPS.  Feels solid.The bad:Emits annoying noise when charging.  Tried 3 charges, all purchased from Amazon.  First had loud high pitched whine, second had loud chirping noise, third had occasional high pitched whine.  Amazon was great at exchanging them until I found a tolerable one, but I would rather pay more money for a charger that doesn't emit noise when in use.
B003TU3S5M	I primarily use a wall charger but keep this in my car fit those day trips when my phone is suddenly almost dead. Never gets hot and gives me no reason for concern.
B003TU3S5M	What can I say.. It's a car charger. I use it with my Galaxy S II and S III with no problems. I'm really a fan of genuine accessories (I don't trust the cheap generic eBay stuff), but I don't like the inflated price. Amazon has genuine Samsung brand accessories on the cheap, which is perfect.You can't go wrong for genuine Samsung w/ Amazon's price. Make sure you buy it directly from Amazon and not one of the resellers! The one direct from Amazon is in fact Samsung brand, and brand new.
B003TU3S5M	What is to be said?  It is a simple car charger that simple works for micro usb devices.  It is somewhat bulky would be my only grief about this product.  Other than that, no troubles at all.
B003TU3S5M	I was looking at off-brand car chargers, but decided to pay just a little more for a Samsung OEM model.  Cannot complain at all - it was only a little more, but I feel like a have a much more reliable item compared to others.  I've had it for a few months now and it works perfectly.
B003TU3S5M	I purchased 2 of these and both of them seem to have the same issue.  The tip of the connector does not seem to be able to make contact with the power outlet in my vehile or any other vehicle.  I need to sodder a tiny bit on the end to be able to use the charger.  If you like projects like that then this is perfect for you, otherwise I would recomend trying a different charger.
B00759TN5C	This product arrived on time and was in good packaging. The first time I used it I realized it did not wanna stay plugged into my phone.  After about a month of use the part that plugged into my phone just t ed off from the charger.  I would not buy this product again.
B00759TN5C	This is a great charger and will charge your phone quickly. I love it, highly recommend. Will be buying another when/if needed.
B00759TN5C	broke 3rd day. not quality made.where the charger plug is there is 2 side wedges that hold the charger to your phone. they are supposed to be big enough to hold your charger there until forced y pulling it. however not to obig as not to fit.THEY ARE SMALL AND DONT HOLD IN YOUR PHONEi have to plug charger in and wrap cord around phone for it to charge.!!!plus is its my wifes and its pinkbad side is color doesnt matter when its broke
B00759TN5C	After receiving the charger we were very pleased at how durable it is. It is bright pink (my wife loves it) and has a thick cord. It's not the flimsy cheap thin ones you get from a flea market or phone store. I would recommend this charger cord to anyone who is tired of theirs falling apart. This thing is solid. It's durable and strong. i just wish i could get one in black for my phone  so my friends didn't pick on me for using my wife's PINK phone charger! Definitely would recommend this item!
B00759TN5C	Not only is this pink charger adorable, it is also the best quality charger I have ever seen out there. Would highly recommend it!! Every other charger out there is garbage.
B00759TN5C	The charger worked really well and charged the phone fast, but after about one month or so it stopped working.
B00759TN5C	Sucks!!!!! Piece of shit stopped working after TWO USES!!!! JUNK!!!!!!!
B00759TN5C	It works great. I love it. Matches my pink seat covers perfectly. Recommend to anyone who needs a car charger and loves pink.
B00759TN5C	I bought one on a whim from a phone store. My daugheter-in-law saw it and loved it!  When I went to purchaseone for her, however, I could not find one.  I did find one online, and she loves it!!  We are the only two in townthat have pink chargers for our cell phones!! It works great and it is PINK!
B00759TN5C	I love this charger because It great because there is a blue light on it and the cord is stretch and so if I have to call someone while im  driving its very easy to be able to charge it at the same time!
B00759TN5C	I love it its girly just what I wanted and it came quicker then what I espected love it so worth it!!!
