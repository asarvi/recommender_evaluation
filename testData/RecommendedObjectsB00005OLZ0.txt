B003VCC8K4	I bought this iPhone stand as a gift for my boyfriend and he may not get it! Great and sleek stand, easy to adjust and an iPhone in a case fits as well. The fun design makes it look like a miny iMac and is extremely sturdy and useful if you want to watch a movie, facetime or anything! Highly recommend this stand.
B003VCC8K4	This is a nice way to monitor your phone activity while at your desk. I'm glad I bought it. I highly recommend this product.
B003VCC8K4	This truly is an amazing stand. My iPhone 4 fit in it perfectly...too perfectly. The phone will NOT fit with any kind of case on. So, if you don't want or need a case, this is the perfect stand for you. If you do, better look elsewhere. The packaging is great. Product was super easy to assemble and performed just as promised. The stand feels solid and performs solidly. Delivery was prompt. Really couldn't ask for more...except end caps that will fit a phone with a case.
B003VCC8K4	We bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it.  It was just what he needed and he uses it all the time when working on his computer.
B003VCC8K4	This stand is perfect for the IPhone 4. It is good quality but because it does not accomodate the Mophie Jack cover on my phone of which I asked before purchasing I am somewhat disapointed. It would be nice if it was adjustable to accomodate the phone covers.
B003VCC8K4	Absolutely THE best stand for the money, hands down! Excellent simple, elegant, sturdy and strong design. Like the majority of the apple products, it not only looks god, it functions beautifully as well. I bought a second one to keep at work and Everyone is asking where I bought it!  One suggestion...get the extension cable to go with the stand since the factory cables are rather short. Don't even look at another stand, GET THIS! You can thank me later.
B003VCC8K4	I love this item. It arrived quickly. However, I did review this long ago. Hope that I don't have to keep reviewing the same item.
B003VCC8K4	I am really digging this iPhone stand.  It looks very sleek and apple-esquue.  I leave this on my desk at work and put my phone in it each day and plug in the cable from my computer to keep it charged.  It is very sturdy and has grips on the bottom so I am able to text or surf the web without removing it from the stand.  I don't watch movies or use face time a ton, but it is very adjustable and would work great for either.  In short - looks nice. high quality. highly recommended.
B003VCC8K4	TItan Iphone 4 Stan Desktop: It didn't work for me, the one that I got differs  a little bit form the one in the picture, at least my impression was this stand will carefully hold the Iphone 4 S and the case, but when I tried to fit it in: first the stand aluminum construction had rough edges eager to peel off layers out of the case I'm using if I force it it and second it was a really tight fit, I could remove the case from the Iphone to make it work, but the rough edges were still there and I don't see the point of having to remove the case every time I need to use the stand.I have a Body Glove 9250701 iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S Diamond case.
B003VCC8K4	This was useful until the small rubber grommet wares out as mine did after only 2 months of light use.
B003VCC8K4	I enjoy using this stand all the time. It is convenient and converts the phone into a mini PC or flat screen TV. It is definitely worth the money for any iPhone lover. It's also light weight and small enough to travel with quite easily. It's great! Hands down...
B003VCC8K4	The five stars are for the Titan iPhone 4 stand by Maclove.This iPhone stand was so awesome that I ordered another one for my desk at work.However, my second order for this item was fulfilled by NTKsolution who sent me a cheap Chinese knockoff in crummy packaging instead of the Titan iPhone 4 stand from Maclove.I have reported NTKsolution to Amazon customer service.
B003VCC8K4	As another reviewer stated, this stand is NOT by Maclove, it is a Chinese knockoff. Search Youtube for a Maclove Titan iPhone stand and it is obvious. This came in a black and orange box that did not say Maclove on it anywhere. It has a label stating it fits an iPhone "4G". The brace that holds the phone is in the shape of an "X", the real Maclove is in the shape of an "M". This only has a thin rubber washer that fits between the brace and the stand base, whereas the Maclove has a thick rubber spacer on either side of where the brace connects with the base. Also the slot in the base that allows you to adjust the angle of the phone is a lot smaller on this knockoff than the Maclove, allowing a shorter adjustable range of angles.Why do I give this two stars and not one star? The stand essentially does its job. It does not look that different from the single image shown on Amazon's page. If you are looking for an authentic Maclove stand, shop elsewhere. If just want a stand that holds your phone and don't care about the things mentioned above, it seems to do the job.
B003VCC8K4	Although I have purchased MANY items on Amazon.com over the years, this is the first time I have ever written a review.  I felt compelled to do so because of the quality of this item. Very nicely made - well finished and sturdy.  Works perfectly to hold my iPhone at my bedside so that I can use it as an alarm clock.  Allows for charging the iPhone while I sleep.  Also the packaging was very impressive - looked like an iPhone box.  Overall, very high quality and functional.  Would highly recommend.
B0056G144O	This is a very solid car dock for the HTC Thunderbolt. This will fit either the standard or extended battery on the Thunderbolt. Mounts securely to the windshield and hasn't fallen, even in the Texas sun. My wife uses this instead of the OEM car dock because of the extended battery.
B0056G144O	It has a recess to fit the extended battery on my wife's Thunderbolt. The ball-joint (and locking nut thread-pitch) matches my OEM Motorola Bionic windshield mount, so we only have to change the phone-holder part when swapping between my Bionic to my wife's Thunderbolt, and only need to store the phone-holder part in our center console. And, I now have a spare suction cup part.Then only negative I can find (and it really doesn't affect how my wife uses it is the rear camera lens is covered by one of the arms. There is actually a slight recess in that arm to fit the slight protrusion of the camera on the back of the phone.
B0056G144O	So hard to find accessories for phones after they're no longer sold... the folks at the Verizon store looked at me like I was crazy for asking for accessories for a phone that was a year old... how dare I expect that my phone wouldn't be obsolete in a year.I've tried universal mounts for other phones in the past, and have always been unhappy with them... was ecstatic to actually find one designed specifically for the thunderbolt.  Thank you Arkon - I had been looking for months.It works EXTREMELY well, and I have the extended battery.  It's a very snug fit with the extended battery, but it does fit, and it's ROCK solid.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase.The mount seems VERY well made... several previous mounts of had felt very cheap, and indeed cracked or broke in fairly short order.  This one feels solid, and leads me to believe it's going to last a while.
B0056G144O	Broke the small arm that holds the phone within first few uses so not very well build would not recomend this.
B0056G144O	For the price, I felt like this was an incredibly good product for my phone. It held my Thunderbolt perfectly, allowed access to phone buttons and micro USB port, and suction cup never came off the windshield. I accidentally bought two of them, and instead of returning the 2nd one I decided to just keep one in each car since they worked great and were a very reasonable price. I have since upgraded my Thunderbolt to a Galaxy SIII and would very much like to buy another mount for my new phone from Arkon.
B0056G144O	I bought this mount hoping it would fit my HTC Thunderbolt with the wireless charging cover on it.  The cover makes the phone a bit thicker in one spot and subsequently made my official car dock from Verizon/HTC unusable.This dock fits the phone with the extra thickness perfectly.  It almost looks like they accounted for that if you look at the little groove in the picture.  I'm not sure, but this dock might even hold the Thunderbolt with the extended battery cover (which makes it ever thicker in the same spot).The dock was easy to set up and the phone locks securely into place.  It's very easy to adjust the position of the phone and unlike a lot of docks it holds it securely without wobble.  Only downside is that it doesn't dock it into charging like the Verizon one, but the port is unblocked so you merely have to plug it in.
B0056G144O	This long LOCKS onto the windshield, without any indication of ever falling off, and has a DEATH GRIP on your HTC Thunderbolt. The ball joint works very well, holding the phone securely in place, while still allowing you to rotate it easily. oh, and this device comes off the windshield easily when you want it to.
B0056G144O	works great for the past month or so holds thunderbolt great price is right. that's it for now. by by
B0056G144O	I mounted this on my window with the suction cup.  Holds fine and accepts my extended battery.  It is important that you insert the Thunderbolt into the holder correctly.  It isn't obvious.  Put it in backwards and it could fall out while driving.The plastic holder is lightweight but strong enough.  The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a power cord.  But I've got a couple already.Enjoy!
B0056G144O	I got this mount because the earlier one I had from amazon did not fit the phone once I went to the extended battery for my Thunderbolt.  I was hoping this one would fit based on another review I read.  1) It fits!  2) You can clip your phone in and out but still have it be charging the whole time.  Like it for both of these reasons!
B006R9IR62	The product is cute but the cell phone stand is really built for one of the older version of cell phones say from about 6 years ago.
B006R9IR62	I bought this for my friend as a gift and she absolutely loved it. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves cute accessories for their phones.
B006R9IR62	good
B006R9IR62	my plush came in good conditions and it came as it said it would, but my plush did have a small  torn part  on it ,but other than that it was great
B006R9IR62	Super cute, fun and handy, but blue holder has a bright pink bow or hat on its head, not blue as pictured.  It's still cute, but as I ordered it as a gift for a guy, I had to remove the pink bow.  Also, shipping was super fast, but item arrived with no tags or packaging of its own, again, a consideration you plan on giving as a gift.
B006R9IR62	Wow. I just saw the plushy, and I immediately went on Amazon to write this unhappy review.First off, it's so upsetting regarding the size. The size is a lot smaller than I imagined. It's palm size and depending on the size of your palm, it may appear slightly bigger or smaller but it's generally a palm size in my case. I thought it would at least be big enough for me to use both hands to hold it but evidently, it's not. However, the plushy does appear like its picture except for the blue heart at the top left corner. Instead, there's a half cut pink flower. It's shape is more like icing on a cupcake though.Not to mention, the cell phone hole can't hold smartphones. Period.But it is cute and soft. But not enough to convince me that it was fully worth it though. I noticed that its face is also dirty with a slight discoloring. Wow.Don't bother with this plushy. I should have bought a pillow pet instead.
B006R9IR62	I'd like to say it Rocks. But my phone is just flipping the whole Plushie over.Not effective as a cell phone stand holder as advertised....
B006R9IR62	Everything was perfect except for the blue heart. Instead of a blue heart it was a pink half cut flower. Good thing I has a small cute bow on the side to replace the half cut heart with now its is perfect. My advice, is you guys want a random pink heart on the head of the tofu, go for it. If not, have a small blue bow ready.
