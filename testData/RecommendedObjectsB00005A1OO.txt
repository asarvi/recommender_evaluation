B002686G9I	This battery was just what I needed for a fraction of the price that the AT&T store charges. The price was amazing, the quality was great, and I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase. (:
B002686G9I	bought this for my wifes phone which had the original battery in it from when she got it. the original would not hold a charge for very long. this new oneworks great.
B002686G9I	Item arrived in a timely manner and works perfectly. So glad I checked with Amazon first.
B002686G9I	This battery is a genuine LG battery.  I charged it and fully discharged it a couple of times and now it lasts for days.  I highly recommend this vendor for price and delivery performance.  They even included a warranty card, a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and a phone number to call if you incur problems.  Nice!
B002686G9I	great value  I bought 2.  battery works great in my smart phone. cheaper than what the leading cellular companies offered.
B002686G9I	I was thrilled that for 5.88 I could save my old phone I'm so used to and comfortable with. (I called around and got quotes up top 50 dollars).The new battery worked! I'm not a techie so I hate change!
B002686G9I	very good battery no problems at all. would buy again! :)  amazon has saved a good phone from the recyclers or trash!
B002686G9I	i liked the quality and the price was reasonable also.  It shipped within the expected time.  very timely! very easy to order!
B002686G9I	The battery of my daughter's LG Neon was lost, and we chose this one from Amazon and it arrived pretty fast after we placed order. It looks almost the same as the original LG battery, and works pretty well with the cell phone.
B002686G9I	after a long battle with the post office i found out that the item was returned to sender i email the sender and received no reply ive yet to get a refund or the item not happy at all
B0030T0UJ4	awesome
B0030T0UJ4	This is a good replacement of my wife's Google G1 phone.  However, it seems the phone is using up lot more juice by design than other smart phones.  The battery does not last too long. then it needs to be recharged again.
B0030T0UJ4	T-Mobile wouldn't sell me "just" a battery. The figured I must really want the newest most expensive phone they have (idiots). So, thank you for putting me in contact with source for JUST Batteries! Thank you,
B0030T0UJ4	it only stayed charge for 5 hours being fully charged the Original one would go at least 24 hours after being fully charged
B0030T0UJ4	the battery works just like the original, wish it held a charge better, I get about 3 to 4 hours use out of it if I use the phone.
B0030T0UJ4	this battery was perfect my phone holds a charge like it did back when i first bought my phone !!!!!high quality at a low price love that too !!!!
B0030T0UJ4	I refurbed my old G1 for my wife. She's been eyeballing my smart phone for a while and I felt that instead of buying a new phone for an extreme amount of money and having to sign a new contract with T-Mobile it would be better to resurrect this old war horse and give it a new lease on life. The original battery had swollen beyond the ability of  the phone to contain and wouldn't hold a charge. I had looked at buying the OEM version of this battery a year ago and the cost then was just silly. This battery is identical to the original OEM and works just as expected. Fast shipping.
B0030T0UJ4	Battery is not OEM, it's a Knock-Off. My phone's original one finally started to die, and this one was cheap. But it is fake. So I'm hoping it doesn't explode or burn my phone up. Buyer beware.
B0030T0UJ4	After an epic struggle with my old battery, I came across this cheap but great battery. I needed my G1 to last a few more months, and it helped a ton! Before I could not use wifi for more than 10 minutes before my battery would go dead, and now it lasts just like new.It is always a risk to use non-oem products, but this was a great one!
B0030T0UJ4	My old G1 died.  For it's time it was a cool phone.  I stuffed it in a drawer and forgot about it.  When I found it the other day I thought maybe it just need a battery.  At this price it was worth trying.  Dropped it in and it's just like new.  I'm putting it on an auction site hoping I can get $35 for it with it's new battery.
B0030T0UJ4	it is A Good product. original, it was on time, and works great for me, it really like to me!!!
B0030T0UJ4	I was told by various outlets in my town, my phone was now an antique though only 2.5 years old.  It was not holding a charge.  Through Amazon I found a replacement battery at a phenominal price.  Problem solved very inexpensively and quickly.
B0030T0UJ4	I assumed getting batteries directly from Amazon, LLC would make it more likely to get an HTC-manufactured battery, but clearly I paid extra for nothing.  Both the first battery and the replacement were counterfeits with the same serial number and part number.  Quality seems low, as they were unable to maintain a stable charge and would cause the phone to randomly crash four or more times a day.  Avoid.
B0030T0UJ4	It works in my phone. it has ok battery life, but it dies over night when it is on stayby mode and not being used even when it's fully charged.
B0030T0UJ4	If you're hoping to keep your G1 alive, look elsewhere.  This battery won't hold a charge.  Try Seido's battery instead.
B004LQTN7A	Added more time to my phone as stated, better than the stock battery the desire z comes with. Fit withouth any issues.
B004LQTN7A	This battery could (and, for me, has) gone almost 2 full days without a charge, and I'm a power user. Throughout the day, I'm getting emails, surfing the web, my WiFi is always on (because I tend to move between multiple hotspots, and the majority of my surfing is done via WiFi), and I send/receive probably 20 texts through the day. When I get home, if I haven't plugged in all day, I'm still between 50%-70% battery.The thing is, you need to condition this battery when your first get it. Because of its construction and the materials used, this needs to be done. The first 5-6 times you charge, you need to wait until the phone basically shuts off. I mean, literally wait until it powers down for lack of any battery, or wait until it's at or under 5%. Then, charge it fully. After this is done 5-6 times, the overall lifetime of the battery will increase, and the phone will also report the battery level more accurately.Also, some things to keep in mind:* 3G/4G uses more power than WiFi. So, if the majority of your surfing/data is done via the former, you'll see bigger power drops than if you used WiFi.* GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi can be easily and quickly turned off when you're not using them; this will help maximize your battery life. Lots of people just leave them on all the time, and don't think about it.All in all, I'm very glad I have this battery.
B004LQTN7A	This thing is lasting FOREVER! Only a few full charge cycles in but this battery is lasting all day and then some. Takes about 3 hours for a full charge with the phone on. Used Battery Doctor to assist with charging and monitoring the initial charge. What worked for me was a full uninterrupted charge, full drain x3. So far so good! 1800mAh > 1300mAh!
B004LQTN7A	I purchased this for my T-Mobile G2.  In the beginning, I was very happy with it.  I thought it definitely increased the length of time I could use the phone.  But now, not quite 6 months later, the performance has fallen off a lot.  And it will not charge to 100%.  After charging all night, it is at 78% or 59%, or some partial level.  Now I have to look for another battery.  That was not a long enough life for this expensive a battery.
B004LQTN7A	Much better life than stock battery. Gets slightly warm when charging, but not too bad.Covers me for the whole day compared to the stock battery which only lasted till 4 or 5 in the evening.
B0053ZIX10	Well, my phone [Sanyo Zio by Kyocera] was turning itself off & when I would turn it back on, it would be completetly dead, no bars. So I decided to try out a new battery, because atleast if I was out & my phone died, I'd have another battery to pop in.The packaging was nice, it came in a little bag through the mail. Overall, this was well worth the 7 bucks I paid. : }
B0053ZIX10	I rated you one star because you sent me a battery not in a package like I ordered and with the battery with a pink strip. I was told if the strip is pink it is a refurbished battery by my cellular carrier.  I did not pay for a refurbish battery.
B0053ZIX10	Exact "Brand Name" replacement for my phone! Great price, considerably lower than the place I bought my phone!Works perfectly!
B0053ZIX10	Amazon keeps sending emails asking for a review so, OK. This is a battery and it fits in my phone. When I put it in the phone, the phone turns on so it must work. It didn't cost too much and came soon after I ordered it. I don't know how long it will last but I'm pretty sure I'll have a new Samsung Galaxy before I find out. If you have a Sanyo Zio phone that needs a battery I recommend this one, otherwise don't waste your money on a battery you have no use for.
B0053ZIX10	Battery is performing quite satisfactorily.  In use for two months more or less.  No problems with charging or life in phone use.
B0053ZIX10	Beware. It could have been a lot worse than it was for me. The battery busted open while sitting on a table and not while in my hand or up to my face thankfully. It was a scary experience.
B0053ZIX10	Bought this battery to replace the original battery in our Sanyo &#34;smart&#34; phone.  Phone was acting up, overheating, freezing up and generally not working very well.  It was suggested that maybe the battery was bad, so we tried this one to replace it.  The battery took a charge fine, but the problems with the phone persisted.  Apparently, it was not so much a battery issue as a &#34;this is an old phone that really just needs to be replaced&#34; issue.If you have an old Kyocera/Sanyo ZIO phone - and you actually LIKE it - this could be the battery for you.  The solution for us?  Get a new phone.Problem solved.
B0053ZIX10	I bought it for a friend,  yet I heard it works great for their phone which needed a new one.
B0053ZIX10	I was very happy with this product. Local stores weren't even willing to tell me if I even had a battery problem. I bought this hoping  it was  battery I needed and it worked wonderfully. Thanks
B0053ZIX10	I hoped I would only need to purchase ONE battery and place ONE order to find a battery to replaced the dead one I was using before.  This battery was put in and in forgotten about.  It works just as week expected.....holds a charge like the original did when it was new and hasn't given us any trouble since.  If you need this battery I would have no problems buying more.  This is a no brainer.
B0053ZIX10	Well, i'm happy to have another battery for my cell phone because with the original one, the battery die too fast.
B0053ZIX10	Battery came in a timely manner and works perfectly. I have had absolutely no issues with my new battery. Works like brand new, well it is brand new. Great price and great product.
B0053ZIX10	This battery only lasted four months before failing.  I would not recommend it to anyone, because it is not worth the money.
B0053ZIX10	I can't tell if the batteries are old &#34;new&#34; stock or new &#34;0ld&#34; stock as they last about a month of holding a long daily charges and a month later they have a short duration of charge lasting about 8 hrs...did this company buy-out new leftovers that have degraded well waiting for him to buy or are these poorly made or....or....or?The real problem is my phone is a 1st gen smart phone that works great and has no problems and I don't know if they quit making new batteries for it or if he bought out leftover old/new stock to sell here or they're china junk!!!As someone once said: &#34;one don't know do one!&#34;
B0053ZIX10	It is what it is... a battery for the Kyocera Zio. It looked exactly like the one that came in my wife's phone (actually Kyocera-branded and not Sanyo-branded like the one in the photos). We put it in, charged it up, and now her phone works again. I ponied up for the quicker shipping, and it came when it was supposed to. Even with expedited shipping, it was a third the price I could have gotten it for locally (plus, I'm not sure anyone in town had it in stock... some store would have had to special-order it for me anyway!)UPDATE: Bought the battery in July, and in December the phone is having trouble again. The phone's original battery didn't last forever, but it did last longer than 5 months.
B0053ZIX10	Excellent product good battery life it stays charged for a long time I bought it to replace the manufactures battery.
B0053ZIX10	As a battery replacement it's solid and pretty cheap.If you don't have a bunch of phone chargers, pick a few of these up and charge them up to use as necessary.
B0053ZIX10	My daughter was looking for a battery for her phone and kept being told they would run her from $40 and up glad to have found her one at a reasonable price
B0053ZIX10	This product was a direct replacement, and seems to work as well as the original.  Here are five more words for their silly requirement.
B0053ZIX10	This battery is working great in my ZIO ( only used for an alarm clock, because to be honest, the phone itself is very poor).This is a brand new &#34;official&#34; battery.  The price was great, i can't complain at all.  Get this battery from this seller if you are in need of a replacement battery for your ZIO
B0053ZIX10	Although it was just a battery, it did serve its purpose. The only downside was the the phone. Previously I had different batteries and they all worked but eventually did not charge. I am just going to assume it has to be a phone issue, because the same happened to this battery. The battery shipped from the east coast standard mail delivery and I received it within 3 business days. After I reviewed other sellers, I found this to be the best buy plus free shipping.
B0058N5LGC	I'm glad I was able to find this affordable bundled rechargeable battery package for my Metro PCS Samsung cell phone.
B0058N5LGC	two batteries and a case, what else is there to say besides the batteries fit and charged normally also the case was a good fit
B0058N5LGC	Arrived on time, and the batteries are awesome!!! I highly recommend this to Indulge customers! Betteries last about 3 times as much as the regular batteries, and the added size makes the phone feel more durable.
B0058N5LGC	This vendor is locater  in china You will wait for ever about a month.The ad didn't say your phone will be big from normal side.your have to give people the option, but is a good deal
B0058N5LGC	These batteries are the best for the money. I needed an extra battery, I ordered these and decided to use these instead of the original that came with my phone. They last twice as long and the case that came with it is a perfect match.
B0058N5LGC	I am using these extra battery on my samsung indulge.The cover could have been better. Some time the volume buttons keep getting stuck in the cover enclosure. But as a overall product I have no complaints.
B0058N5LGC	This makes the my second and third batteries of this exact type.  I ordered a great charger that I also reviewed that charges these up just great.  These definitely extend the talk and standby times of the Samsung Indulge phone.  These batteries have lasted over 45 hours without a charge.
B0058N5LGC	One battery won't hold charge the other doesn't last even a whole work day I would not recamend these to anyone.
B005CMVSLG	Extended battery works great to allow me to play online games throughout the day. Buys me 2-3 more hours than the original battery.Still looking for a silicone case that will fit over the slightly larger phone as the battery is about 2x fatter than the original, thus the new back cover that comes w/ the battery.Let me know if anyone finds a case that fits the new fat phone!
B005CMVSLG	the door was a aftermarket generic door and would stay on keep popping off and then the battery would fall out and I would have to to reset the phone it was annoying and then it eventually cracked and was replaced with a factory extended battery door from another vendor,  now the battery works and is great no issues there
B005CMVSLG	the extra capacity battery & back cover fit and work perfect. I had purchased an off brand back & battery before, neither one was a good fit, battery needed charging nightly, and the back cover kept coming off. Now this new cover stays on, the battery needs charging every 3 days. Great!
B005CMVSLG	Battery is great! 4 stars. Can go 2-3 days on the 3500mAh. Avoid the hassle of during the day charging because of high use.Battery door cover not as great. 2-3 stars. It didn't fit as well as it should have. Not OEM.  Coughed up $6 for an OEM battery door cover elsewhere and am happy.For me, the battery itself is worth the price.
B005CMVSLG	This took awhile to get to me but when it did I was happier than peas in a pod. It works great and I no longer have to charge my phone several times a day to support my phone game habit!
B005CMVSLG	I'll keep it simple the battery works well,  its a good value, I have twice the life of a standard OEM battery, the only down fall is the cover doesn't fit well and has cracked along top edge. Had to order different cover that is OEM for extended battery it is perfect.
B005CMVSLG	This battery came well packaged and arrived on time. I easily get  2.5 to sometimes 3+ days off a single charge depending on how many apps are running on phone. Well worth cost.
B005CMVSLG	The battery came on time and in good condition with the replacement back cover for my phone.  It fits into the Continuum without an issue but when the phone is turned on it shows an "unsupported battery" message.  The phone will run off the charge on the battery but when you attempt to charge it up, you get another message that the battery is unsupported and it will not charge.  Even my battery widget said the battery was a "failure".  I have requested a refund from the seller (YESOO).  Do not buy this product.  Will update with YESOO's response.
B005CMVSLG	Bafter works very well. as most people, my days are very long. With this battery, I dont have to worry about charging in the middle of the day. The only drawback I see is.... You cant find a phone cover to hold the phone since it is approx twice as thick as before. Yes I would recommend if it dod not concern you not to have a cover. Four stars and a half for sure.
B005CMVSLG	This battery is advertised as a replacement (extended) battery for the Samsung I400 Continuum. When I plugged it into my Continuum, a message immediately came up - "Unsupported Battery". However, the phone's functions worked. Then, when I tried to charge this battery, the phone gave another message: "Cannot charge unsupported battery" and, the charge failed to initiate. I have sent a "Return" request and have not yet heard back from the Seller (YESOO).
B005CMVSLG	What a pleasant surprise! Using my phone with the extended battery makes life so much easier. Now if I could find a protective cover that would be awesome too.
