B004887IC8	It is a nice belt clip case at a good price.  The only drawback there are no cut outs on the side to allowing access to the headphone jack while your phone is in the case.
B004XR91VU	Purple TPU Candy Rubber Case Cover for Samsung Droid Charge 4G LTE i510 i520I am very pleased with my order. The order came faster than expected even around the holidays. Also I am very satisfied with the quality & the great look it gives my phone. Thank you.
B004XR91VU	Wife loved the color! This was mainly for the woman of the house. She was very appreciative. Carried the cover with the phone everywhere she went. Also made for a good detection when displaced.
B004XR91VU	Amazing Cover for my phone! Fits like a glove! I just wish I had been able to track it and that it didnt take so long to receive it.
B004XR91VU	I actually purchased this as a gift giveaway for one of my employees who loves the color purple.  The product was as expected.  The individual is still using and loves the durability of it.
B004XR91VU	love this product, received this item sooner than i expected to. would buy something similar in the future if my needs change or i decide i need a change.
B004XR91VU	this case is sturdy and cute. my phone has no dings or scratches because this rubber case absorbs the blows. why buy at the all when you can get the very same product here for pennies on the dollar?
B004XR91VU	I foolishly put my cell phone on top of my car while putting my son in his car seat and then promptly forgot and drove off. Somewhere around the mile and a half mark, my cell phone flew off the roof and landed in the gutter. Fortunately for me, someone driving behind me saw it and retrieved my phone. I was certain that at the very least, the screen would be completely cracked. When I picked up my phone from the very nice man that found it, it didn't even have a scratch on it. Maybe it was a fluke but at the very least, the rubber case kept my phone from sliding off of my car until I took a sharp turn and provided enough cushion to keep the back from flying off. My phone has also been dropped dozens of time (once in a toilet - gross!) and remains unscathed. I know that other reviewers seem to hate this case but it works for me!
B004XR91VU	Its lasted over two years now - great, protected phone from drops several times.  The only drawback is my car charger does not fit in snugly when the case is on, so I have to prop the plug in.
B004XR91VU	The wife loved it. Protects phone a little when dropped. Good variety of colors. Purple is my wifes favorite color.
B004XR91VU	I love the color and the argyle effect.  Goes on and off the phone easily, which I like because I do use the desktop cradle and the car dock slot.
B004XR91VU	I Love the cover..the color is pretty and unlike some of the other buyers, the entry holes match up perfect. I think the price is good..the shipping is a little high, but over all it is worth the price compared to $19.99 at the store. Would buy from them again.
B004XR91VU	My wife loves her fun stylish phone cover and so does her chiropractor.  I guess I like it to because she's happy that she has a cover for her phone, which Verizon did not have at the Verizon Store.
B004XR91VU	very nice and pretty phone cover,Dont have anything else to say just love the color and pattern of this phone case
B004XR91VU	I cannot criticize this cover. I accidentally left my phone on the roof of my husband's car. It stayed there all night (thank God it didn't rain) and he drove to work the next day about 10 miles on the high way and then found the phone when he got to work. It never fell off. So yeah... I have no complaints.  I'll also never do that again haha...
B004XR91VU	Purchased this looking for a durable phone case that fits well, and it has held up to the description.  It is a soft, yet hard case that fits the phone very well.  Would definitley purchase this product again.
B004XR91VU	This is a good product. It stays on the phone, fits nicely, and is easy to remove.The only issue is that the "wake-up" button on the side is covered with flexible plastic which is too stiff and hard to find in a hurry. I have a vinyl decal that can be seen through the cover since it is partially transparent--looks cool!
B004XR91VU	when my boyfriend and i first purchased our sam dro chas.. we got the hard plastic that has a nice grip cause it looked and felt great.. but as for the protection part - this is the cover to have!!!i drop my phone often and luckily this cover provides absolute protection.  the hard plastic would just fall apart @ impact and cause my phone to keep moving and scraping against the floor.
B004XR91VU	This case was super easy to put on my phone (and super easy to take off, but it stays on firmly). I did need to wiggle it to line up the USB port with the hole for it, but now it's fine. The case adds very little thickness to the phone. The only thing I'm not thrilled about are the covered buttons. I find it impossible to locate the power button without looking, and the volume buttons are also difficult to find. Additionally, I have to push pretty hard to make the buttons work - usually I use my thumb nail to direct all the force onto the button only. On the other hand, it will protect the buttons against grime, and it would be difficult to push the buttons if they were surrounded (but not covered) by the case.The case is translucent purple - it's easy to read the "4G/LTE" text on the back of the phone. However, the colors in picture here isn't really accurate. The case is going around a black phone, so naturally the black darkens the purple, and makes it less reflective. The result is a darker (blue-er) purple, which is more understated. Personally, I like it a lot better, but if you're looking for something flashy (and shiny) you might want to look elsewhere.Overall, I'm pleased with this cover. The color is nice, it is easy to put on/off, and it's not big. It helps a lot that I only paid $4 for it. (The "list price" of $18 is ridiculous.)
B004XR91VU	I purchased the purple candy rubber case for my smart phone about a year ago and have been pleasantly surprised at the excellent protection that it has provided.  I have a tendency to drop things and my purse is not always as smart phone friendly as it should be.
B004XR91VU	Is somewhat rubbery so doesn't fall down when I lean it up against something to read text.  Want one for my new Nexus 7.
B004XR91VU	I recently got a new phone so I obviously don't use this case anymore but nonetheless I had this specific case on my phone for about 6 months without taking it off. It was completely reliable and always fit snug on my phone. There were absolutely no downfalls of this product. You're always going to see bad reviews on every product but take a risk on this case because you will not regret it!
B004XR91VU	I really like this cover since it seems to offer a good amount of support for banging and droping hazards. The only thing is that I needed to take an exacto knife to the opening around the charging outlet to open it up a bit since the charger wasn't able to go in the phone all the way.
B004XR91VU	I owned a rubber case similar to this one before purchase and I think they are the best cases for any cell phone (if you are not the type that needs the belt clip kind).  I swap my batteries out frequently so it's very convenient that the case slips on and off the phone easily.  The color is bright!  If you like purple then you'll probably love this color.  There are two things on this particular case that I did not care for.  Instead of having open button slots where the volume controls are and the same with the button that activates the screen all three are covered with raised like buttons on the case.  On the rubber case I had before this one all three of those buttons were exposed making it easier to use them.  On this case you have to press hard to hit the button through the rubber.  If that is something that wont bother you or you are the type of person that is rough with your phone you will probably appreciate what I though was a flaw on this case.
B006U45T7Y	I ordered this phone case a couple of weeks ago and I love it! It looks exactly like the picture. It is good quality case. I've dropped my phone with the case on and it stayed looking the exact same way. No scratches or chips. It is worth the money!
