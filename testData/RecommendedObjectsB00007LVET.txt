B000ROCJ2Q	Holsters that hold up under everyday wear & tear are rare and cost a lot. This one not only works well but at a reasonable price. The leather is high quality and the elastic holds the blackberry firm but not too tight. The belt clip is also heavy duty and is holding up quite well. I have no issues with this product.
B000ROCJ2Q	I bought this at the last minute because I was going to a trade show and I didn't want to be carrying this in my pocket (which is how I used to carry my blackberry). I spent a week on the road with this and I wonder how I ever got along without it. First, its a clip-on -- belt, pocket, whatever - which I normally don't like but this one is fine and it holds very well (I usually clip it on the edge of a pocket). After now a month of use, I've also discovered this thing makes the battery last much longer -- the BB turns off when inserted into holster (you still get vibrations when stuff comes in) -- and its significant. I no longer need to charge my BB every night!
B000ROCJ2Q	This is a really nice holster, with handsome leather and a pretty secure belt clip.  The problem is that the clip is just a piece of plastic, and less than a month after I got it, it broke off.  So now I have a nice looking case for the Blackberry but no way to clip it to my belt - I have to carry it in my pocket.  There are worse things, of course, but it sure is a pain.
B000ROCJ2Q	Excellent product. This was the second one I bought, because I lost the first one and I missed it too much.
B000ROCJ2Q	It is hard to find "Brown" so get it!  The swivel makes it easy to place or remove your blackberry with one hand.
B000ROCJ2Q	I bought this for the price and lambskin material to replace my lost original case. This works just like the original, and the price is great.  The case wasn't as soft when i started using it, but after awhile the touch is close to the original mfr case.
B000ROCJ2Q	I'm impressed with this case.  The leather is soft, not that harsh stuff unusually reserved for similar items.  The color is more of a dark brown.  If you stare at it long enough you may be able to convince yourself that there is more than just a smidgen of red in the coloration.  The sides that form the "pocket" are black elastic.  The holster fits securely on my belts and purse straps.I like the fact that the clip is hinged and can be opened by pressing the top of it with your thumb.  This allows you to place the clip as you wish without forcing it onto your belt or whatever you want to clip it to.  The clip does swivel, but locks into place.  Set it the desired position and it stays.The holster allows for unobstructed access to the headphone jack, charge port, mute, and volume buttons.  The closure is magnetic, allowing for quick access to your phone.The decorative silver Blackberry insignia adds a little "something" to the case, without making you a walking billboard.  If someone is close enough to see that it reads Blackberry, they are probably too close to your phone.
B000ROCJ2Q	Great holster, I can't imagine anything to make it better!  The closure is secure, yet easily opened and closed.  The swivel clip is flexible, but will not turn involuntarily.  The leather feels and looks great and the quality is obvious. Great buy!
B000ROCJ2Q	Case looks good and the magnetic lock closes securely.  If you want to swivel the case so it's angled on your belt (or pocket or lower lip or whatever), you can move it a couple of clicks and not worry about it twisting further and dropping The Precious.And who do we have to blame for manufacturers' inability to use normal names when describing the color of their products?  Bush? Congress? Crayola?  This case is brown.  Just brown.  Okay, dark brown maybe.  Not earth, chocolate, dusk, saddle, frappacino, walnut, Oprah, or anything else.  Just brown.
B000ROCJ2Q	This is a nice looking case and well designed.  Unfortunately, the magnet inside the case is not position correctly for the 8300 and the phone does not recognize that it is in the holster.The first time I traveled out of town I snapped the case off my belt.  The plastic broke off the clip.  Needless to say, I didn't buy another one.Pass on this case!
B000ROCJ2Q	So what, my wife makes fun of me because I want my accessories to match.  Well, the black case with brown belt and brown shoes was bothering me.  The ecru case I ordered was too light, alomost white, too light even to go with my topsiders.  I'd love it if RIM made a buckskin colored case...Anyhow, great case, beautiful leather.  I wouldn't call it red by any means, the one I have is straight brown with no red tones I can tell (yeah, and that coming from a guy who makes sure his belt and shoes match...) It's a nice rich dark brown, and a great alternative to black.I do wish the clip's top was a bit lower, irritates my love handles if I'm not wearing my shirt tucked in, but with a shirt tucked in it's fine.
B003WIP598	The phone case is great, belt clip or belt loops, magnetic cover and leather. At this price I should have bought a couple extra.
B003WIP598	I guess you get exactly what you pay for.  For the money this is a good holster but don't expect the same quality as more expensive holsters.  Not very substantial.
B003WIP598	I like it just hard to get the phone out when it rings.  But great for the price and good protection for the phone.
B003WIP598	Not a really durable product, but GREAT for the price.  Strong clip is hard to get off your belt at times and if you are not careful it will tear the material, but it has NEVER fallen off.  This is my 3rd and for the price I'll keep ordering more, I am a little hard on them so they don't last a year.
B003WIP598	I bought this because it's a leather product, it will hold up over the long period of time.  Unlike other matierals, that will tear, and expose the metal clip.  This product is easy to get on and off your belt, and the product is reasonably priced.  I have enjoyed using this cell phone case, and I would buy from again.
B003WIP598	I ordered 3 phone cases that have a belt clip and 2 belt loops.  The photo showed the case with belt clip and belt loops.  What I received was 3 cases with belt clip only.  Not what I ordered.  I will keep only because I do not what to have to go though the process of returning.
B004CFS8RQ	I purchased this holster for blackberry torch 9800. However the proximity sensor magnet is located for blackberry bold and therefore does not trigger the sleep mode for the torch 9800.
B004CFS8RQ	Fits well. A bargain. I like it better than BB case sold for the Torch. A little plastic-ey but can't complain.
B004CFS8RQ	phone does not wake/sleep when coming out of and going into the holster.  I think I prefer the verticle-type holster more...personal preference.  was tight at first, but broke in and held the phone well.  I used it for a couple of months, but now just keep the phone in my pocket.
B004CFS8RQ	THE MOST COMFORTABLE CASE IVE EVER USED AND EASY TO OPEN WITH SLEEPER FUNCTION. MY BATTERY LIFE IS MUCH BETTER NOW!
B004CFS8RQ	I was a little hesitant to buy this product since the official BB site did not list this product as an accessory for the BB Torch.  This case definitely works for the BB Torch, fits like a glove (some may think its a little tight, but in my past experience, it should loosen up a bit after some use), very well made (nice stitching and workmanship) and made of good quality real leather.  It does have a magnet in the proper place to turn off the phone's display to conserve battery life once it is properly inserted in the case.  Great value as well.If I have a neutral comment, it would be the plastic swivel clip which makes the case stick away from your belt a tad.  Since this is a horizontal case, I'd much prefer a simple standard fixed clip.
B004CFS8RQ	This horizontal side pouch case with swivel holster for my Blackberry Torch is fantastic. It hooks on my belt very easily and the horizontal orientation makes it much more comfortable to wear. It has a magnetic flap which holds the phone in very well and the leather is great. I would highly recomend this holster!
B004CFS8RQ	I first bought a Splash Alpha Lambskin Leather Case with slim-profile rotating belt clip for my Blackberry Torch 9800. When I first rotated the belt clip, this caused the metal underneath that was supporting the clip to become exposed on the sides and ended up tearing the leather and seams. I knew this case wouldn't last long and that the metal piece supporting the clip would probably end up injuring me so I returned it.I then purchased from a Amazon seller, this Blackberry Black Horizontal Side Pouch Case With Swivel Holster For my Torch 9800 and although I agree that at first it's a tight fit, I find this case to work perfect for my needs. After using this for awhile, I've found that the leather did loosen up some and that this case is very durable, stylish with gray seam stitching  and has a easy to rotate quality made clip. The front has a metal emblem with the Blackberry Logo and on the back of the case, the clip also has the logo. I see nothing to indicate that this isn't a genuine Blackberry product. When I bought my phone I was told there was only 1 Genuine Blackberry Case that would fit it, however after doing some research on cases, I found that there were more and what I was told wasn't true. I also found Amazon and private sellers offered these cases and at better prices.I can't say anything negative about this case and think it's a great value!!!
B004CFS8RQ	Another classic and professional accessory from RIM. I love the stitching, it makes for a very luxurious appearance. The position allows the holster to be positioned closer to the belt buckle than in the typical side / hip position. The BlackBerry emblem adds an extra touch of class. Also, a nice touch is it allows the headphone cord access while in the holster. I enjoy listening to Pandora while my phone is in the holster. Very convenient and hands free.
B004CFS8RQ	I bought this case for my dad because of the executive look, but the torch phone is actually a little too big for the case. We assumed it would probably stretch, but then I went to the Blackberry Store in Minnesota (airport) and they told me that Blackberry never made a case like this for the Torch. There's a vertical holster that is made specifically for the torch that you can search for. It's worth it to get that one for the fit and the magnets.
B004CFS8RQ	I received a torch back cover instead of pouch!! you are some jokers!! no star. How could you make such a mistake?
B004CFS8RQ	Great quality for the price, like the feel...seems durable and will last a while....I definitely recommend purchase. The only thing is that I wanted to keep the case I have on the phone in case it falls while out the holster but it won't fit with the case on.
B004CFS8RQ	If you have any type of protector case on your Torch it will not fit in the pouch. I have tried to stretch it but the magnet will not clasp.
B005163JNS	Overall the Seidio Convert is a great phone protector/holster. The inner case has kept my phone scratch free, the rubber coat and outer skeleton has protected it from several drops from about waist high but, this is the second outer holster I've been through in 15 months. The first lasted 1 year before the retaining clip at the top broke. The replacement was $15, a better deal than replacing the whole thing for $35, but the new one only lasted 3 months. Both holsters broke at the pivot point of the hinge joint. The rest of the case is good enough that I'll buy a replacement holster one more time. If this one breaks I'll revise my rating downward and buy a different brand.
B005163JNS	MY HUSBAND HAS BROKE 2 OTHERS. HE TENDS TO GET IT CAUGHT ON THINGS AND BREAKS THE CLIP OFF. HOPE THIS ISNT GOING TO BE A HABIT
B005163JNS	Product as advertised, great value for the price, easy transaction, arrived sooner than expected. The holster clip broke after a few weeks, not really made for everyday wear at work
B005163JNS	Broke the original, bought this to replace it. Old 1 lasted over year this 1 is going on 2 years still doing good. I am a landscaper that works outside everyday so I am usually tough on these kind of things.
B005163JNS	GREAT holster. I have my EVO still running AOSP rom so why get rid of it? The only thing the phone needed was a real battery and protection and I had both but the clip broke after about 2 or 3 years and this is the replacement. I HIGHLY recommend Seidio products they are well made and well thought out. Practical. Also my EVO has bounced down the full flight of stairs a few times and been dropped from 6-8 feet and it's fine.
B005163JNS	I bought one of these Nov 20th. The latch broke Jan 18th. To make matters worse, I own many phones in my business that use this same holster. Just about all of them have failed. I think this is the 6th time I have ordered one to replace one that broke.Here is what causes them to break (I think). The latch is pretty durable as long at the phone is in the holster. But if you take the phone out of the holster and you apply any pressure at all on the latch, it will break. If you take the phone out of the holster, take the holster off of your belt.
B005163JNS	I use this for my Galaxy S2 with a case and really like the fit, holds tight and is easy to release.
B005163JNS	it is a good holster i need one fast and it came on time . i am happy with the holster i would recommend this holster to others.
B005163JNS	I need another holster because mine broke, so I went back on Amazon just to see if they sold it separately. Surprisingly they did, but they were out of stock. A day or two later they got them in and I ordered it right away. Two days it was here!!!! Thank You So Very Much Amazon and Amazing Prime!!!!
B005163JNS	This  thing  does  whsat it's supposed to do  but  I can see  that it will eventually havee to replace it.  It snags on too much stuff  but I doubt they can fix that
