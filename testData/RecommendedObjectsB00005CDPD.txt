B001AS5R90	It just works, I have been using it for about 4 months now in my car, connected to an Ipod touch second generation, I get in to the car and the gateway is always ready, I just need to turn my ipod and just works!
B001AS5R90	I use this with my Palm Pre smartphone and it automatically pairs up with it whenever the car is powered on/off.
B001AS5R90	No need for docks, remotes, Airport Express, etc.  I can see all of my music + playlists right on my phone or ipod from anywhere in my house.  The volume and mute buttons even work.  I connected this to my 2 Blackberry's, iMac (10.6), and iPod Touch 4g (4.2) with no issues.  The sound and range are great.  I am very happy with this little gizmo which is about the size of an ipod shuffle.
B001AS5R90	Bought it to connect my iPhone to my BMW to play pandora and rhapsody music. Hookup was quick and easy. sound quality is excellent. Interface with phone function is seemless. Recommend highly
B001AS5R90	I have been looking for a Bluetooth gateway for my car since it has an Aux input in the armrest and I have been wanting to get rid of the wires. After using both for a month now, the winner hands down is the Blackberry. Then I had issues of connecting to my Evo. Now the gateway is dead and won't turn on. It appears form electrical issue but not sure.
B001AS5R90	Been using this little guy for a few weeks now and I love it.  In a house with three laptops, three gaming consoles, all connected over wifi as well as a handfull of cordless phones and a few cell phones, this bridge is completely free of interference.  No pops, no hisses, no echos, I love being able to get rid of that wire that was dangling from the front of my stero and now can connect my ipad, laptop, cell phone etc. with the touch of a button.
B001AS5R90	I wanted a solution to send my iPhone 4's music over bluetooth to my car stereo with minimal fuss, and this device does a great job.  Included with the device is a 3.5mm stereo audio cable (male to male) and a 3.5mm stereo audio to RCA cable, which I used to connect the device to my car stereo's auxiliary input.  This bluetooth gateway has no battery so you'll need to buy a mini USB car charger, but the benefit of this aspect is that if you leave it plugged in, when you turn on your car it automatically starts up.  Whenever the iPhone is in range, it pairs automatically without having to do anything, and all I have to do is hit play on my iPod, Pandora, NPR or whatever app I wish to use.  Working just as I had hoped so far!
B001AS5R90	I pugged one of these blue tooth devices into my boat's stereo. I didn't need the power supply because the Left Coast stereo has a USB charger built in. ( USB charger & 3.5mm sound jack is exactly how the Left Coast stereo works ) It was totally plug-n-play.Plug it in.Turn it on.My iTouch came up with the blackberry on its blue tooth list.Type in the "0000" and bam! It worked!This thing is great!The only bit that I don't like is.. Why the on/off switch? I really want it to be always on when it has power.-jim lee
B001AS5R90	Love this thing.  After pairing it with my phone and ipad it automatically detects it when I enter the car.  Music is controlled from your device instead of using a third party remote like other car solutions.
B001AS5R90	I have this product connected to my car stereo and play music through my Blackberry. Great product!
B001AS5R90	Pros: Crystal Clear sound, Great PriceCons: needs to be plugged in to power to workI really like this unit, it works great with my iPhone 4. I just happen to have a normal plug in in my vehicle, so the power cord isn't really an issue to me.  I would be nice to minimize the amount of cords in my car though. That being said...it's the best accessory of its kind (for the price) that I've managed to find.
B001AS5R90	I use this in my car with my AUX jack, and I am able to seamlessly play audio from my phone over A2DP to this receiver.  I love it so much, I bought a 2nd one for my wife's car.  Sound quality is amazing and indistinguishable from playing a CD.
B001AS5R90	As everyone noted, it is very seamless.  Even pairs automatically when it is powered on or when within range of the unit.  Better implementation than the Belkin which does NOT automatically pair at start-up.
B001AS5R90	I have been looking for a Bluetooth gateway for my car since it has an Aux input in the armrest and I have been wanting to get rid of the wires.  I searched on Amazon and purchased the Miccus Blubridge gateway and this blackberry gateway.  After using both for a week now, the winner hands down is the Blackberry.  They both produce very clean sound with no hiccups on my Iphone 4.  The Miccus has a built in battery, but since this will never leave my car I don't see a need for it and having it always plugged in will cause memory effect on the battery as well.  The Miccus also was not as loud as the Blackberry.The Blackberry will blow you away with the volume and sound quality!  The most important reason for choosing the Blackberry is that it "remembers" your device!  I get into my car, start it up and choose my music...its that quick. This device saved me from buying a new stereo.  My Iphone 4 with pandora and sirius playing with the incredible sound quality of the Blackberry gateway makes commutes very enjoyable.  You won't be sorry....
B001AS5R90	As many people do, I expected to fuss around trying to make another Bluetooth function.  It worked first time, and everytime simce.  I just love this thing.  I'm running my iPod nano w BT adapter into this thing connected to my guitar amp for backing tracks while I play gutar alongside.  It just works!  Wish it had a battery tho.
B001AS5R90	Picked this thing up for around $30, and it works perfectly.  It even came with the power supply (a few reviewers on other product pages on Amazon had said it didn't, this one does, as it is listed in the listing name).  I can't put into words how awesome it is that I'm streaming audio from my macbook to my speakers across the room... via bluetooth! Setup was so easy I had to double-check I hadn't plugged the audio cable into my computer, but surely enough it was wirelessly streaming my music. Flawless. All you have to do to set it up is plug it in, search for bluetooth devices, pair, and click "connect/use as audio output." Couldn't get easier than that.  Taping the top turns it on and off, it re-pairs almost immediately once turned on (I assume it'll behave the same if you go out of range and then back into range).  Gonna buy another for my dad to use.  So cool. So elegant. So easy. Get it.
B00329UMHM	These head phones are perfect. Sound quality is superb. the look is as stylish as i am. it's the best head set for any teen or young adult, and very durable. Thanks amazon for wonderful service.
B00329UMHM	Bad purchase never arrived at its destination marketers never bothered to reply or send me the tracking number refunded my money but that does not have the bad times that made me go I will not buy anything from these vendors
B00329UMHM	great for phone use and the mic is very sensitive, not for regular headphone use though. The earbuds slip out a lot and they sound hollow so sound quality is low. Also mine broke after a couple of months, but I liked them enough to buy the same brand, they were cheap anyway.great for blackberry storm
B00329UMHM	Very fast service & awesome headphones. I love them. I'm very happy with my purchase. The price is very reasonable and the quality is great too.
B00329UMHM	Cute, but annoying. when the cord splits into two wires, one is long and the other is short, and so one keeps getting pulled out of my ear. They don't stay in my ear very well, and they feel weird in there. But MOST IMPORTANTLY the sound doesn't work right in one earbud. The volume seems normal on one side, but super quiet on the other. This happened after very few uses. I bought a new set now and I'm not looking back.
B00329UMHM	I bought this Item so that my grandchildren won't keep borrowing mine. And now they fight each other for this pair of headset.
B00329UMHM	Great product.  When I only have the earphones in my ear and not on, I literally cannot hear any outside noise at all.  GREAT PRODUCT, but no matter what I do, the ear buds keep popping out.  They will never stay in. I can't even have a conversation sitting or laying down and NOT moving.  I bought them hopping the rubber buds would keep them from falling out of my ear when I would run on the treadmill, but it won't even stay in while sitting.
B005R220RC	This product was extremely disappointing. It was supposed to have a comfort grip, but instead is made out of cheap plastic. It was also advertised to have a button on the handle, to answer calls. The one I received has no buttons on it. It feels like a child's toy, and I will not be using this product.
B005R220RC	This was a Christmas present for my wife and her Iphone because she kept hitting her touch screen with her face (I thought the touch screen was supposed to shut off when it was next to her face)  It works just like it is supposed to and is just great - but cort strung to her purse has become a pretty good reminder for her to charge her bluetooth.It works just the way it is supposed to - I'm just not sure why you would want something that would work that way.  It's a novelty - like a whoopee cushion, you may soon lose interest in it!
B005R220RC	The price was perfect compared to others. It came brand new in the box. It works just gone. Durable. Everywhere I go people ask me about it. Will be ordering more.
B005R220RC	Now, I can talk on the Phone long time with my best friend.I really like this Retro POP Handset!!!
B005R220RC	Got two of them in different colors for the grandkids.  They love them and they work well.  Well worth the modest cost.
