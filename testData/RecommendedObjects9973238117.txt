B002LDAXTW	This is a very strong and well made cable. It will last a long time and the wires won't come apart like the last one I ordered. I bought it for my 365 Neon phone and its reasonably priced for being a well made cable.
B002LDAXTW	Works great and it was cheap.My old phone got left in my pants and got washed.My son gave me his old phone to use.i might as well use it for know.Thanks
B002LDAXTW	Great cable with a nice length... It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well! What's not to like? I just love Amazon :)
B002LDAXTW	Amazon has a habit of shifting its tech reviews to irrelevant products, so the following text addresses the ORIGINAL OEM Data Cable for your LG Neon GT365 USB cable.I only the cable with WinXP: The LG Neon GT 365 phones do not need any driver to be recognized as a disk drive in XP.To transfer files with the cable, you must first turn on your phone and _then_ connect the cable to your computer (which should already be on). Windows Explorer then sees two drives but only one contains photos, sounds, videos, etc. The other appears to be a some kind of placeholder drive with nothing on it.You can then use Windows Explorer (not IE, duh!) to browse and copy files. Another hint: Use Copy and Paste instead of Cut and Paste in case unknown factors (power outage, cat or kid yanking at the cable for fun) can cripple a file transfer.To use the cable as a charger with your computer, make sure the phone is powered off, wait a few seconds, and then connect it to your computer (trust me, a wall outlet charger is faster).
B002LDAXTW	The USB cable worked as promised as long as you follow Mr. Loeb's advice.  Now I can charge and transfer files easily.  THANKS!
B002LDAXTW	After connecting the cable, I was able to transfer pictures from the cell phone to the laptop.  It was plug and play.
B002LDAXTW	This cord didn't work for the phone at all, and it wasn't sold on my island either hence why I bought it online but it was still useless.
B002LDAXTW	this cable saved me! my lg neon screen suddenly stopped working and the screen wouldn't turn on! i was so upset because my phone had 2 years of pictures that were very important to me! so i purchased this cable in hopes that my pictures would download onto my computer.... and it worked! i turned my phone on (even though its kind of difficult to tell when its on considering my screen doesn't turn on) then i plugged it into the computer and a window popped up and it said view pictures. so i viewed my pictures and all 180 of them were there. so i clicked import, and all my pictures were saved  into my pictures file on my computer! it did this in a matter of seconds!i had no problems whats so ever! i was so happy and now i can get my pictures printed so those 2 years of memories wouldn't be lost! :')
B002LDAXTW	Absolutely no complaints on my end!  I'd been looking for such a product for a while now, yet had not considered looking online for it.  I was actually looking  for something different & this product showed up in the "Others bought this" section.  I ordered it immediately.  Product arrived earlier than I expected & works great (does exactly what I wanted for it to do).
B002LDAXTW	wasnt the right cable. my girl owns an LG Neon. This cable did not fit. Maybe its only for certain ones or something, i dont know.
B002LDAXTW	It is a cable i plugged it in and it worked...its really neat i dont even own an lg fone i used it on my gf's htc...dont tell lg
B002LDAXTW	lg cables work well for the price.i don't have this phone anymore.but I do decided to get the phone  again.  i would be more then happy  to buy another in the near future.
B002LDAXTW	Cable worked perfectly with new phone. What I liked the most was the price. It was most cost effective compared to other vendors. I shopped around to several places like Target, AT&T and Walmart and found this cable to be overpiced at these locations. I was also pleased that the product came within the expected delivery time. I would definitely purchase future accessories online.
B002LDAXTW	The vendor sent me the wrong cable, and I could get the right one only about 2 or 3 weeks later. (ok, it was about christmas and I sad that I had no hurry). Anyways the right cable works good on my GT365 (neon), but I cannot manage my contacts using it (this is a problem with the phone, not the cable).
B002MS8BGS	Great deal!!  Shipping cost more than the .99 cents I paid for the cable.  Cable appears to be high quality.  The local store in town wanted nearly $20 dollars for the same cable??
B002MS8BGS	This cable dose exactly as describe, but you may need to download New Samsung PC Studio for your computer to transfer between devices. Just go to the Samsung website.
B002MS8BGS	Haven't used it yet, but I'm sure I'll find it useful with my new phone while transferring photos and data to my computer..
B002MS8BGS	I liked the cable but could not get the software to load on any of three different computers. Therefore the sync cable did not do anything.
B002MS8BGS	Great to be able to find out of production sync & charge USB cable for my old Samsung Solstice A887 phone.  Worked great
B002MS8BGS	great product, fit my phone and got the product in a really short amount of time and the price was right.
B002MS8BGS	This cable is very handy.  It's great to charge the phone with and to transfer files back and forth.  The charging works just as well as the charger that came with the phone!
B002MS8BGS	It's a pretty simple product and worked perfectly with my Samsung Solstice. I would recommend that anyone buy the USB hookup so they can fully use the phone's features.
B002MS8BGS	Good product.  Works as advertised.  Allows me to charge my phone and load music onto and pictures off my phone.
B002MS8BGS	Cable has work properly every time I have used it. Good cable so far for the price. Time will tell how it holds up.
B002MS8BGS	Bought for my husbands samsung flight II cell phone and he really needed a sync cable not so much another charge cable, and instead it only charges, not sure what the problem is.
B002MS8BGS	This will do the job for your BB phone to PC.  All owners should have to sync there equipment with.
B002MS8BGS	FAST DELIVERY. RIGHT CORD FOR THE RIGHT PRICE. WORKS FLAWLESSLY. YOU MUST DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE AND DRIVERS FROM AT&T WEBSITE SO THAT THE PHONE WILL RELATE TO YOUR COMPUTER. THEN YOU'LL BE OFF AND RUNNING. SEAMLESS, SWAP PICS BACK AND FORTH AS WELL AS OTHER DATA.
B002MS8BGS	Its ok,but do not mets my expectations.I try to hook up my phone whif it but my phone gets crazy soo i have to disconnet it.
B002MS8BGS	I have video on my cell phone that is too big to send to myself through email... no biggie, I have a card reader on my computer.  Problem 1... The card is under my battery, which means I have to take off the case, take off the back take out the battery and I believe I had to take out my sim card as well, to get to my card.  That's a lot of work, but worth it to get my videos on the computer so I can share them.  Problem 2... the card won't read in my computer.My wonderful husband knew just what to do.  He bought this cord and it is exactly the right thing for my challenges.  I plug it into the computer, then into the phone, and everything else just pops up so I can copy my video files and put them directly into the computer file I want.  Thanks to this Sync Cable (and BONUS... it charged my phone while I was using it!), I am now once again, able to bore my friends and family with video of my kids and dogs! :)
B002MS8BGS	This cable does not fit Samsung Soltice A817.  The phone plug is too large for the charger recepticle which is much smaller. There is a difference between the A817 and A887.
B002MS8BGS	cable is fine. samsung PC interface software you can download separately wasn't very good. but that's not the cable's fault
B002MS8BGS	This is a really great way to transfer photos and other digital media from your Samsung phone to your computer. It's also really convenient that this charges the phone as well! Though we did have to download a program to import pictures onto our computer, this product was very much worth it.
B002MS8BGS	This product works great with my Samsung Solstice. I use it every day and have experienced no problems. I would recommend this to anyone who has a Solstice A887. Also, the seller ships fast and would highly recommend buying from them. Enjoy, Susan.
B002MS8BGS	Just What I Was Looking For....My Other Cable Shot Craps But I'm Pretty Sure I Got That One From Somewhere Else.....  Ty :)
B003B9GEZ2	This works fine for my Motorola Blur MB300. Very cheap price. I had to buy it because I lost my charger and didnt want to pay too much.
B003B9GEZ2	Awesome price, cord works well. I lost my original one while moving and bought this one because it was cheap.
B003B9GEZ2	Her old charger broke, and I ended up finding out that this charger was not the right one. But since that's not the fault of the company and it came in good condition, I'm still willing to give them a 4/5
B003B9GEZ2	I'm sure all of these cables are generic but the one that I purchased from eForCity in particular (on this listing) was worthless. I kept my phone on while connected to a laptop but it charged the phone at about 5% of the rate that the cable that comes with the phone charged it at.
B003B9GEZ2	Although I didn't use this USB cable about half dozen times due to switching phones but I never had any problems. I always was able to sync and/or charge my Motorola Backblip. The price was also loved.
B003V42NCU	This I thought would be great for the price but it did not last long.  The wires became exposed from one of the ends and was only from gentle use.  So it is not very durable.  Tried to use to charge last week and does not work anymore.
B003V42NCU	This cord came fast, in minimal packaging, and it works! It was a pretty safe thing to buy, but I have no complaints.
B003V42NCU	It's inexpensive, it works, and it arrived promptly.  I noticed that the description doesn't include a length so just in case you're curious, the cord is about 34".
B003V42NCU	I rated this product a five star because it's the best, oh by the way I'm using it now to charge my cell. Loving it!
B003V42NCU	Even though this item's price is 1 penny, I haven't find any problems with it. I reccomend it, and it is very durable, I have had it for about 4 months!
