8199502487	I still use this phone, because it is a great phone. The charger is tough and durable. The products can not be found in stores.
8199502487	It works and their hard to find. It charges very fast. It's not as sturdy as  the original.Seems a little hard to remove cord from the phone don't want it break.
8199502487	Although the head that goes into the cigarette lighter is rather large, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. It charges well, has a good connector and seems to work just as expected!
8199502487	For the price, this charger is great, it does what it is advertised to do. I wish more companies products would = what they are advertised as.
8199502487	I love the product, the only point of contention  I have, was it took almost ONE MONTH to reach me. I live in Santa Cruz Ca. the product was shipped from the Los Angeles area, a distance of about 375 miles. It took numerous email and phone calls to reach someone. Next time I'l just go down to the Verizon store four blocks away, and buy one there.Verizon wanted $19.95 BTO wanted $4.99 That's a great deal but the hassle outweighed the savings. Once I finally got hold of someone named Lance at BTO, he was very helpful and put another unit in the mail for me, which took 3 days to reach me.
8199502487	My wife goes thru these every 6 months or so. The cable breaks near the phone or opposite end. This one seems to be made better than last few.
8199502487	I'm so happy I pick the right car charger for my Obama Cell Phone! It's hard to find the older model adapters since everything is updated now! Thank you Amazon.com for having everything I need.
8288834531	i got this for the bluetooth headset that i oreded at the same time and i was told that it was in stock. i waited and waited and all i got was the car charger so i waited again and then i get a email that says that the bluetooth is on back order and it wasnt going to come in for another month so i canceled the order and now i have a charger that i dont need and i havent seen a credit yet and is ben about 3 weeks i dont think i will be ordering from here again
8288834531	I am satisfied with my purchase.
8288834531	This product works just fine.  Well priced, good quality, nothing fancy but does the trick.  Packaged well and arrived on time.
8288834531	Provides that quick charge when you are on the go and the Voyager PRO's fantastic battery finally runs out!  An excellent purchase and a great price compared to the box stores!
8288834531	Excellent car charger for my Plantronics Voyager PRO.  I was a little fearful of using it at first but had to one day and it worked wonderfully.  I'd recommend it to anyone ... largely because I got it from Amazon.  Amazon hasn't missed a target yet for me.
8288834531	Does what it is supposed to do. No frills.One tip/idea/piece of advice: plug the charger in to the auto receptacle AFTER starting the vehicle. This will prevent power surges and blown fuses. It's a hard habit to break if you are in and out of the vehicle...but this will prevent possible frying of the charger and/or device being charged.
8288834531	works great, just what I had in mind. easy to use. handy to put in a suitcase and take with me
8288834531	The Plantronics car charger works as advertised which I have been using for some time now. I would recommend this product.
8288834531	We bought this as a gift to go along with a Plantronics headset. We were very pleased with the quick delivery and the price. It was also in perfect condition when it arrived. We would definitely recommend this seller.
8288834531	Very helpful to have a headset charger in the car since I usually forget to charge things.  I got this at a great price and it works great.
8288834531	The charger is very good. Only time will tell if it will last. Most of the products that are manufacturered from plantronics are of sound quality. It's perfect for the bluetooth and does not over charge the unit. I have always had very good luck with products purchased through AMAZON.
8288834531	Good quality charger I am very happy with the product. I would recommend this product to my friends and family
8288834531	Great product. Fulfills its purpose. Not going to ask too much more of it than to charge my phone and Bluetooth.
8288834531	Charger was as advertised and reasonably priced. Was more than half the price of any I could find in local stores.
8288834531	It works well with the headset, so I can keep it charged while on the road, and don't have to worry about running out of battery power
8288834531	Feels very solid and works wonderfully. Slides into the cigarette lighter very easily unlike the one that actually came with my phone. The red led light is a bit bright but you can't miss it and you know the charger is working. Very please with it so far
8288834531	My wife spends a lot of time in her car and needed this charger for the car. The Voyager Pro bluetooth works well and last long 5-6 hours. The car charger does the job we need as a back up.
8288834531	This was purchased so that I could charge my Plantronics headset while in the truck. And it does that just fine. Has a red light so you know when it's on. Does it's job. I would buy from this seller again..
8288834531	It didn't work. Wasn't worth my time to mail it back.
8288834531	Not much need be said: This is a good little charger for Plantronics earpieces. LED indicates it's plugged in; charged my Voyager Pro + in 1.5 hrs.
8288834531	Plug n play.  But it's a simple device.  Exactly as advertised.Beyond that it's hard to wax poetic for the required word length.  :)
8288834531	Works as advertised, Metal body. Better then the ones you get online and Wal-Mart that are plastic, and beaks easy. I would recommend this one.
8288834531	Bought this for my husband's Voyager PRO. He is a truck driver so this was much needed. While the charger worked great, the headset itself took a crap after 2 weeks. The company did not help whatsoever even though it was under warranty. So we ended up trashing it and buying a BlueParrot headset. Best decision we ever made.Charger: good for the 2 week durationHeadset: Didn't block sound as it was suppose to and just stopped workPlantronics customer service: HORRIBLE. THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY.
8288834531	works really well, i ordered it because i couldn't tell if the head set came with one. it did, so now I have an extra one. but so cheap always good to have another
B000ARU12A	Came in pieces with the fuse and top cap out and off.  So far it has power to it after screwing it together. Will see how long it works.  Same problem with the one I had before that stopped working.
B000ARU12A	This product fits my motorola bluetooth headset perfectly. It worked well and it was at an amazing price. The only problem is that now it has stopped working but I think I was a little rough with it and it broke. I am going to be buying another one because it wasn't the product's fault it was mine. So I would recommend this as a best buy.
B000ARU12A	my buddy gave me a motorola bluetooth headset but didn't give me a charger.  all i wanted was a cheap charger that worked.  i got the charger plus shipping for under $10.00.
B000ARU12A	This product recharges my Motorola bluetooth hands free device quickly and easily.  Highly recommend.
B000ARU12A	Things did not go well with this purchase. I did not pay attention to the charger and unit to be charged not coming from the same seller. No biggie just a 1 cent and shipping lost.
B000ARU12A	Other than I hated they changed the actual charger for the motorola HS810 I have no problems with it.
B000ARU12A	Close your eyes and grab it. Works awesome, I charge my Moto bluetooth while travelling as I lost my normal charger.Works reallly good and flawless.Enjoy it...
B000ARU12A	I bought this car charger when the prongs on my regular charger broke and it seemed to work perfectly.  And it only cost me $5 including shipping.  Then the other day, it stopped working. My GPS charger worked fine, so it is not the outlets in my car. The red light on the part of the charger that plugs into the outlet does not light up, indicating no electricity is running through.
B000ARU12A	Very helpful to have but haven't used it yet. I just labeled it since it is mixed up with other car charger items.
B000ARU12A	Not many of these left around! Our previous one was stolen in a car theft and this one is doing the job great. Haven't had any problems with connectability and charges quickly.
B000ARU12A	Works as expected...what more can you say about a car charger for a Bluetooth Headset?  Very fast shipping as the item arrived in 2 days!
B000ARU12A	I recieved this in a couple of days and it worked great.  i am now able to use my old bluetooth headset and not have to purchase new one.  Can't beat it for the price.
B000ARU12A	wounderful people and wonderful job im so proud thank all that you do for me  and  i  love  this  charger  i  use  it  all  the  time  thank  you  so  much
B000ARU12A	This is a good product with a great price.
B000ARU12A	This charger looked like a bargain because of the price, but in both of our cars it blows a fuse in the car if you plug or unplug it from the cigarette lighter socket while the car is running.  The only way I can plug it in is when the car is turned off.  No other cigarette-lighter plug I've ever used in these cars has such a problem.
B004FRCMXW	Great way to be able to charge all of my equipment on the go!  Highly recommend this item for Android users.
B004FRCMXW	Doesn't charge as fast as normal chargers and stopped charging after like 4 months but i guess for the price its ok
B004FRCMXW	Received this product quickly and it works well and is a nice bright orange color that my son loves. I would recommend it.
B004FRCMXW	Works good, no problems- wish it would come with usb cord but I will suffice. On time shipping and product was in new condition.
B004FRCMXW	I bought for my granddaughter and she said she loves it because she can now say that she won't need the old car charger with the cord and she can keep in her purse or arm rest in the car and she thank me so much for getting it for her and she would recommend people to get one
B00632DXWQ	works fine
B00632DXWQ	Works well for HTC Hero S.  It's a life saver since these smartphones use up battery very fast.  Good value.
B00632DXWQ	is not for an htc hero.  it doesnt not fit in my phone and not sure why it says it would.  i needed one for the car but still dont have one because this one didnt work.  Again will go find one at the flea market because at least i will know if it fits.  would never recommend buying this online.
B00632DXWQ	Phone seems to get much hotter when using this charger. A retractable one I bought recently does not heat up and the phone doesn't get hot like it did when connected to this charger. Also, the coiled cord does not uncoil very well or very far.
B00632DXWQ	The car charger is perfect and just what i expected it to be.  I will make future purcahses from this vendor.
B00632DXWQ	Great value. Works fine for htc evo.  For what you pay, I didn't expect much, but am happy with what I got.
B007L5YEA4	This is a good charger and it does work when you turn it a certain way in your car lighter. If you bump it a little it won't charge so you have to keep your eye on it and make sure the light stays on to let you know it's working
B007L5YEA4	I does what its supposed to do, hasn't broken, and was incredibly inexpensive. What else could you possibly ask for?
B007L5YEA4	It works every bit as great as an original.  Wish the cord was just a little longer, but other than that, no complaints!
B007L5YEA4	I love this charger. I keep it in my purse for those times when I need to charge my phones or my kids needs it.
B007L5YEA4	I had a hard time plugging this in to the car outlet...had to really jiggle and twist the upper part to get it to fit in properly and hold a charge (red light illuminates), but now it does what it is supposed to do with my LG Optimus Q, so hopefully the fit issues are resolved.
B007L5YEA4	This product is OK. The connection plug is a little loose, so I have to make sure it positioned &#34;just so&#34; to charge my phone.
B007L5YEA4	Great price and it does what you want.....charges phone. I used the other day to put a little charge on my phone. My phone status showed 67% and by the time I got to destination ( about 25 min. ) my phone showed 93%.
B007L5YEA4	It does its job. Price is awesome. Its a typical car charger and charges quickly. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007L5YEA4	My wife and I have different phones....this charger works for both.  Great and affordable for our trips.  Would reccommend this for anyone in need of a car charger.
B007L5YEA4	Was having a problem with my new smart phone not staying charged up. This car charger allows me to keep it going when I'm using high-drain programs such as the GPS program, which I use a lot.
