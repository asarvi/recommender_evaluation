B000B6AAYY	I bought theMonster Mobile Ultra-Low Profile Vehicle Power Adapter for Motorola RAZR V3, A780, and Blackberrya while back and have been completely happy. After a recent trip with no power, I decided to track down a good charger for on the go. I ordered this based on my previous Monster experience. I am so glad I did.Why you ask? Simple.This charger is so freaking small. I had no idea and based on the pictures you won't either. The gold-plated charging "pins" disappear when you fold them into the adapter. Not only does it charge quickly, it's built like a tank and because of it's super-slim size, it fits anywhere.One of my best buys to date.
B000B6AAYY	Well-made and compact. Great value for the money at $5.95 and free Prime shipping. Better than other adapters that I have bought.
B000B6AAYY	amazing product...fast charging, super slim design. i don't know how monster does it but if can get your hands on one of these you should...it's amazing.
B000B6AAYY	This inexpensive charger at Amazon is great.  It's a really nice and thin charger, perfect for my laptop case for traveling.  Collapses quite a bit.  Works fine on my Motorola Razr cellphone and Blackberry Curve, since both have the mini-USB connector.
B000B6AAYY	item performs very well, slim size only lightens the load, but still takes up same space on the wall outlet or power strip, really could benefit from narrower design as well.
B000B6AAYY	I purchased this charger as an additional charger for my BlackBerry 8830. Unlike the OEM charger, this one comes with a plug that fits at a 90 degree angle to the phone, making it easier to use when the clearance to the side of your phone is restricted. Since purchasing this, it has replaced my OEM charger as the primary charger for my phone. Wonderful product!
B000B6AAYY	I used this for my Blackberry Pearl and the usb plug was real tight.  It actually made my OEM adapter too loose for my blackberry.  I thought it was just my Pearl than I tried it on a curve and the same thing.  So I ended up giving it to a friend who had razr and it fit fine.  I bought it off Amazon for real cheap so not a real big loss.
B000B6AAYY	It worked and it was under [...] bucks. bought it as a filler item. I would rather not support Monster. They are a pretty dirty company.
B000B6AAYY	Very slick device but does not work with Motorola Razr (even though this was advertised). Therefore, I had to return it. Overall very disappointing.
B000HHTF7U	First of all I must mention that this is not the original Nokia stuff(not that they claim it to be but just FYI)...The charging rate is slower than usual, so u charge longer.The length of the chord was quite less.That apart the shipping was prompt... came in within 3-4 days.
B000HHTF7U	Researched, purchased and received these two chargers for my cell phone and it works great and was a great bargain
B000HHTF7U	I noticed how a lot of other people said it took longer to charge. I really only charge my phone at night so I don't really notice the time frame. But that's all the time I need and it works fine so I'm very happy with it. And for 1 cent you can't go wrong!
B000HHTF7U	I am in doubt to purchase this charger when I read other's reviews. But it works fine for me and the slim size design is portable to put into my suitcase. Pleased with the fast delivery.
B000HHTF7U	In one week all my chargers to my phone broke. Thank God I had an extra battery. I ordered a new one it came in the mail in the nick of time and the rest is history....Hold on someone's on the other line...Hello(^_^)
B000HHTF7U	The product is offered at $ 0.01 cents - please do not even waste your money on this one. It takes more than 8 hours to charge my N95. Currently i am using 2 different aftermarket chargers and they charge the phone in 1-2 hours of time. On top of this if somebody tries to refund this product the shipping cost will not be refunded. Therefore you only get back $ 0.01 cents. In todays practical world does somebody even have time to fight for $ 0.01? Maybe i was the only unlucky one but this will be my review for the product. Be very careful while buying aftermarket stuff (not only this charger) and try to buy original manufacturer stuff if you can afford.
B000HHTF7U	I last charger I got was at Walmart. I went to buy another one and found out they do not sell them any more. So I went to Amazon and found this one. It is just what I needed and arrive just as fast as one I paid 2 day shipping for.
B000X272U6	I ordered the Nokia 6555 Travel Charger and the seller did not send what I ordered. I returned the items along with a short note explaining they had sent the wrong adapters and have not heard back from them, nor have I received a refund.I will never order from this vendor again.
B000X272U6	Item was shipped as ordered and received when seller advertised it would be received. It was in good working order.
B000X272U6	The item arrived on time and works good. The Nokia 6555's charges only last 90 minutes. This is a great accessory to recharge the phone at work and a lot cheaper than AT&T's $20.
B000X272U6	I ordered nokia 6555 and I got nokia 6101 which doesn't fit at all. Obviously I'm going to send it back. It'd be nice to leave an updated review stating that I received mine and it works great. We'll see :/
B000X272U6	I received my battery charger in a timely manner.  I ordered this charger to replace the original one that came with my phone.  It did help me to determine that it was not the charger that was bad but that the connection inside the phone itself must be worn.  I am glad that the price was so reasonable that I could afford this test without spending a lot of hard earned money.  I really appreciate items such as this being available.
B000X272U6	dont know how you do it - so little cost, small shipping and a great charger w/ fast delivery time!  WOW! Thanks!
B000X272U6	worked perfectly, very hard to find, was skeptical but pleasantly pleased  especially for such an old phone.  I recommend it
B000X272U6	EXCELLENT SELLER!! Seller went above and beyond my expectations. The rating is on the product and not the seller. The charger and battery did not get the phone to work. I'll have to explore other options to try and retrieve my photos in the phone. Again...I want to praise this seller for her help. EXCELLENT SELLER!!
B000X272U6	This is exactly what I was looking for.  Works perfectly and fit the budget!
B000X272U6	I use the Nokia 6555 as my travel phone, so the travel charger is very important to me. This one is more substantial than the one I got with the phone: less likely to kink or short out.Also charges more quickly than 2 other replacement chargers I'd bought while traveling in South America. Both those also failed early on. So far so good with this one and for $3, including shipping, you can't go wrong.
B001GV4AVW	This charger works really good my batteries hold the charge from it nicely others have asked where I got it and I told them Amazon, thank you
B001GV4AVW	My new Motorola RZAR came with a different charger than my previous RZAR that had a much better charger. Cables were more flexible. The new charger failed and I needed a new one fast. Not only did I find the older original but also at a good price. Shipping was super fast so I wasn't out of commission at all. Amazon is a great place to shop for excellent selection of products at reasonable cost.
B001GV4AVW	short cord and charges slower than oem chargers. It also stopped charging after a few months. so i would spend the extra $5 and get a real charger.
B001GV4AVW	One cannot live without a phone charger!  How else will you keep the battery charged?  This sentence will fulfill the requirement for 5 more words.
B001GV4AVW	This is OEM.... exactly like what came with my cell phone.... worked very well and the price is unveliveable. Recommend highly
B001GV4AVW	This is a perfect replacement for the charger that came with the phone.Other supposedly compatable ones did not work at all
B001GV4AVW	Couldn't wait to receive this cord.  Works justgreat and as an added extra it was longer than myoriginal cord.  Price fit my budget nicely and theservice was quick.
B001GV4AVW	great to have an extra charger at home in case I forget my one at school... since that's why I had to buy this
B003O9IE0W	I paid twice the amount for this Blacberry charger when I gought it the firts time.I left the first one in a hotel room. Checked out Amazon price vs Blackberry andsaved big time.
B003O9IE0W	Compact and well priced. Though this charger does the job, I do not recommend you to buy it if you intend to constantly plug and unplug it. It's better for leaving it on the same outlet sort of permanently.
B003O9IE0W	The product worked for my blackberrey and kindle.  I liked the fold-away prongs.  It was inexpensive enough that I bought two.
B003O9IE0W	Att wants 20 bucks for this well think got we don't have to pay that.  It works great on my blackberry bold 9700
B003O9IE0W	After returning home from vacation, my original charger was damaged.  I purchased this travel charger for my Blackberry Bold and I'm very satisfied with it.  I purchased a second one to keep at my office. I even like it better than the original charger that came with my Blackberry because it is less bulky. It is so compact which makes it easy to travel with.
B003O9IE0W	It was a very good price for a charger and it  works well.It folds up to a  small  size for traveling.
B003O9IE0W	When you need extra charges (wall or auto) for your Blackberry, you can pay an arm and a leg at local electronics retailers or your cell phone carrier, or you can get exactly the same charge for a fraction of what they charge from Amazon. This charger is exactly the same "OEM" one that came with my Blackberry.
B003O9IE0W	This is a great little charger. What was even better was the price.  Very inexpensive.  Good deal would buy this again.
B003O9IE0W	i bought this charger to use on my blackberry bold 9650 as a charger on my computer desk the original i use at my bedside i use this new charger with a desktop charger i also bought on amazon which i will review that also don't buy this without buying the desktop charger.i had a blackberry curve and i was plugging in the charger on the side and 1 day the plug fell right inside the phone so i had no way to charge my phone. so i took my phone to the my repair store near me they told me they had never seen this happen before and would do nothing fpr me, so i had to pay $100 for a new phone thank god it was under warrenty or it would have $500. so when i found the desktop charger thats all i use now! the only time i use the side port is to connect the phone to my pc and thats it.so far i've had no issues with the charger it works great! for the money you cant go wrong it was cheap in price! great in quality so far if it fails i'll edit this post to let you know if it does!
B003O9IE0W	Products works like its supposed to. Arrived quickly and on time. Will buy from company again. Merry Christmas and happy new year.
B003O9IE0W	Its a good replacement for people who work at different locations and leave the charger at those locations. I liked it
B003O9IE0W	I ordered two of these chargers for my employees' BlackBerry Bold phones.  Worked great.  These were a lot more affordable that the ones Verizon was selling.
B003O9IE0W	An OEM blackberry charger for a super low price. Not sure how they make and sell these so cheap.Great extra charger for my travel bag.
B003O9IE0W	This is a great charger for my blackberry and as a bonus, it works for the Amazon Kindle Fire.  The cord is longer than the original charger.  I just might get another one to use at work.
B003O9IE0W	Not only do I have the one I got with the phone, but I have this one that is in my travel bag so I cant forget the charger. It works out nicely for me.
B003O9IE0W	got it on time where i wanted it, received it, opened it, tested it, loved it!!!  just as i wanted!
B003O9IE0W	Good, works well, the only compliance is that the cord is little bit short, longer will be much better. for the money you cant go wrong it was cheap in price! good in quality
B003O9IE0W	This OEM travel charger works exactly as it should. No hiccups or suprises. Good price and shipping.  No complaints.
B003O9IE0W	Ordered two of these, one worked fine, the other one didn't, I think the wire was broken,.....didn't complain, I thought the price was low enough that it madeup for the one that didn't work.
B003O9IE0W	The HTC charger that came with my HTC Inspire and the subsequent chargers I bought to replace it are cheap little pieces of ...junk!My mother in law's Blackberry charger worked so well that I ordered a bunch of them. Had HTC spent more in manufacturing a quality product THEY would have received my business, since I still needed more than one charger!
B003O9IE0W	This product is BlackBerry, but very lightweight. It will charge most cell telephones, but not suited for any other BlackBerry product. Lightweight wire makes charging take longer.Stopped working when the wire was pinched, even with no damage to exterior. Very little insulation. For the price, glad both it lasted for my trip and I do not need it now.Quick ship.
B003O9IE0W	The chargers are great!!!!!  They work well. Thanks much for such good item for one to purchase. I am pleased
