B000BLALEI	It's amazing...the best cost x benefits at earphones....there is no words to describe the quality of sound of this time piece....
B000BLALEI	I like these headphones, but am not as overwhelmed as I was expecting to be based on the reviews I read.  These phones deliver clear music, and the comfort is better than most others I've used (the Sony over the head inside ear phones I had before that came with a Walkman were the best).  I guess I was hoping for sound quality to be as good as an over the ear phone but it's not.If you're looking for comfort, something to use on the go, these are great.  If you're looking to reproduce a cinema experience then you should go for a quality headphone that covers your ear.
B000BLALEI	These A8's are very comfortable and soundfantastic.  The fit and finish are also top quality.
B000BLALEI	I have been looking to purchase these Bang & Olufson headphones for almost a year. After reading many reviews, I finally traveled an hour and a half to the store at King of Prussia Mall. I was offered to test the headphones with my ipod before buying them.The fit was absolutely amazing. There are 3 different ways to adjust the headphones so they fit your ear perfectly. When I was testing the headphones, the sound was great. I heard parts of songs that I never noticed before. I listened to my music for about 15 minutes, and then decided to purchase the headphones.They came out to be about $170 which is very expensive, but worth it for the fit and "sound quality". Not to mention these were supposedly the best headphones for an active lifestyle.  Because I run everyday and sought better sound quality than the headphones that came with my ipod, I thought I should treat myself.However, on the car ride home, I realized that I made a terrible purchase. I could hear the radio clearly through the headphones. I thought the problem could be fixed by simply turning up the volume. Now the volume in these headphones do not need to be turned up very high for the music to be loud. This is good, but with the increasing volume, the only thing that seems to get louder are the drums. There is no bass in these headphones whatsoever. J Kelly was right when he said that the headphones that come with the ipod have better bass. I read his review before buying the headphones, and did not listen. To anyone else who is thinking about buying these headphones, please don't waste your money.I have to now make time (return policy is 7 days) to drive another hour and a half down to the mall to return the headphones. Save your time and money and try something else.
B000BLALEI	I love these earphones. The trouble I had with my standard-issue earphones with my Nano was that my earpieces fell out when I was doing stuff. These have a collar which confortably attaches them to my ear. The sound is awesome. Like having my home Bose speakers in my ears...great sound. Tremendous comfort. Great value.
B000BLALEI	I purchased my first set of these headphones in 2000.I repurchased as I damaged the first set.At the time I thought they were great-sounding headphones.I used them principally with my minidisk players.Then when I started using iPods in 2003, I found the B&O; lacking in bass, actual loudness, and not extending far enough into the ear.  I actually thought the white buds that came with the various pods I've owned were better.That is, until I purchased a set of Sennheiser MX550 in-ear headphones.  I paid about $A27 for them.  The sound is amazing, perhaps only eclipsed by the B&O; in terms of clarity, plus they have a feather-weight volume control forming part of the cable. Before writing this review, I again tested one against the other and was entirely convinced the Sennheiser completely outperformed the B&O; - and at $A160 less.
B000BLALEI	I used Bang & Olufsen A8 headphones for a year walking around and running until someone stole them.Their virtues - excellent sound for small headphones that are not in-ear, look great, and stay on well.Their drawbacks - cost (although they are the best combo of the 3 virtues on the market), they take noticeable effort to put on each time because of the multiple ways they adjust, and the wires tangle with the hooks if one puts them in one's pocket.I had no reliability problems despite treating them poorly.I hope whoever took my B&Os; is still enjoying them.
B000BLALEI	This is my 2nd pair (1st chewed up by my dog.) This pair is the best I have ever had.  Comfort, sound - everything is perfect.  They are expensive, the only downside, but worth every cent.
B000BLALEI	The previous reviewer really hit the nail on the head.  The biggest problem with these earphones is the sound quality.  There is no richness, fullness to the sound at all.  It's quite tinny, no bass.  I've recently reverted back to my standard ipod earbuds because the sound quality is so much superior, even if they do fall out of my ears every 2 minutes.I was misled by the incredibly positive reviews on the apple website, and want to stress that if you are an avid music lover and your priority in an earphone is superior sound, these are NOT the earphones for you - particularly at this steep a price.Another issue - just as I had to constantly readjust the standard ipod earbud and push it back into my ear, I too have to constantly readjust the back of the earpiece to keep it tightly fitted so it doesn't hang loose and fall off (right ear's ok, but the left one apparently isn't B&O; compatible).Wish I had a better earphone to suggest, but I'm back at square one.  I would not, however, recommend this one to any of you on the market for a new pair.
B000BLALEI	THE BEST EARPHONES I HAVE EVER HAD COMPACT DURABLE THE SOUND IS JUST AMAZING ,,,,,,,,,,SUPER,,,,,,,
B000BLALEI	The B&O; headphones are extraordinary in many respects. The sound is excellent - not as bass-heavy as Bose are, but a lot cleaner in sound, which is actually more "honest" and true to the actual sound of instruments and voices. If you put them on correctly the low frequency end is very good, and the mid and high ranges are excellent anyways. I listen mainly to classical music, the sound quality for that is overall excellent. On iPods the benefit of these headphones is a significantly higher volume than for example with the standard Apple headphones. Normally it is very difficult to hear classical music with an iPod due to the low volume, but with these headphones this is no issue.I have read complaints about putting these headphones on - I had no such problems. You have to think for a second which goes on which ear, then lift the piece that goes behind the ears, place the centre-piece above the opening of your ear and then simply push it all back together again. The aluminum is excellent in terms of design and durability. Don't pull on the cables too much, they look a little fragile.These are, in summary, extraordinary headphones. They are not the kind to be thrown into a backpack or stuffed into a pocket, these should be treated with care and sensitivity. The design is outstanding and the sound quality very clean and open, not artificially enhanced in any specific area of the spectrum.
B000BLALEI	I am crazy about the design of this product, which is totally user-oriented. Besides, the sound quality is satisfying. I really enjoy it.
B001PM2HJE	I purhcasedPlantronics Voyager 855 Bluetooth Headset (Black)from Amazon a couple months back and eventually my cable broke. Amazon had the least expensive replacements by far and so I pulled the trigger with them. There is a hint of white noise in my ears with the new set but that could have been something that I just never noticed before that had also happened with the old stereo earpiece as well.
B001PM2HJE	Accidentally stepped on the original and this one replaces it. Works good seems to be the same quality and such as the original.
B001PM2HJE	Like some of the other reviews, the original can wear out if not treated gently. I now take it off the headset and have a case for it. I bought this replacement and it works great. Came in the PLANTRONICS packaging so it's oringinal parts. Good price but watch out for shipping cost. I live in Canada and it was about $22 bring my total to about $40. Good news was I got it in 4 days.
B001PM2HJE	Excellent product because it saves the cost of buying new headset.  Just plug in stereo cable and works perfectly!  Item arrived on time in condition promised.
B001PM2HJE	Love my Plantronics 855, but...due to wear and tear with the doggle, the doggle ear plug no longer works.  This replace is ideal because it is cheap(than buying a complete replacement) and does exactly what it suppose to.
B001PM2HJE	I needed repacement because I left the attachment pluged in, placed my headphones in my backpac and the attachment broke. Loved the sound so I needed to replace just the stereo attachment.
B003JQLIC6	It was cheap at the time which was a good thing but the wire easily burst after a month of continuous usage. probably my bad luck but thought it would have been more durable.
B003JQLIC6	Junky.  Flimsy ear but covers made of lightweight removable plastic.  Cord does not serve as an antenna, as did the cord on the original headphones.  Sadly, I only bought these to be able to listen to the radio, so these are useless to me.  They were advertised as being good for listening to music, so I thought that meant they would work as the originals did, but no, you have to buy a special model for that.  The return penalties and postage were prohibitive, so I was stuck with this item.  Not at all what I expected in terms of quality or features.
B003JQLIC6	I was pleasantly surprised when I removed this from the package, at how  robust the wires were. I've seen too many thin and flimsy earbuds wires, so this was great. It should bode well for longevity. As for the sound, it has a nice full sound, with good bass and treble. Not super high-fi, but for the money definitely worth it.
B003JQLIC6	Works perfect with my cell. I can hear better on these than with the phone up to my head. People on the other line can hear me perfectly, no garbling, no echo, no hollow sound. Just perfect.
B003JQLIC6	These were just as described - actual Samsung earbuds that work great with my Solstice.  I like the right angle connector and the sturdy cord.  It has a mic for handsfree operation.  Great for listening to music or audiobooks while on the go.
B003JQLIC6	This is a replacement for the original and works well. The original was lost and this new headset fit the bill perfectly.
B003JQLIC6	The headphones are decent quality and the sound is clear but cannot use the attached button to receive a phone call
B0047YJD6C	Seem to work great, no issues, no complaints about performance of ear piece.  It feels a little uncomfortable around the backside of my ear, but you get used to it and its not wireless, but I have yet to find a good wireless earpiece , so that is why I purchased this.
B0047YJD6C	Works fine... but if you move too much with it, the connection is a bit touchy... Overall for such a price a good alternative to bluetooth
B0047YJD6C	Well, what do you want for about 5 bucks!Sounds quality is okay. Microphone is okay. A bit fiddly to adjust to your ear the first time, but fine after that.Needs the included 2.5-3.5mm jackplug adapter to work with iPhone.After using the first one, I liked it enough to buy two more - one for the office, one home, and one for in the car.I would actually rate it 3.5 stars - which you cannot do here - so gave it 4 stars in order to not undersell it.
B0047YJD6C	I have a nice bluetooth headset but I wanted a wired headset to keep handy when the bluetooth is not. I wasn't looking to spend much but I wanted something decent.  I tried a pair of Samsung ear bud style. I think They were $2 or $3.  Very cheap, and I got what I paid for. I found them pretty much unusable. So I 'upgraded' to the Jabra C500. It's not the best, but for the price they are pretty good.  The sound quality is good. The cord is long enough to keep the phone in your pocket, on a table or in your car's center console. For me, they are not as comfortable as 'possible' and since I hear better out of my left ear, it would be nice to have something that would work in either ear. This only fits the right ear.  If I paid any more for this, I would give it less stars. For the price, they are very good.  I'm sure there are much better headsets out there, but for around $6, these are pretty good.  FYI: I use them with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the included adapter is required.
B0047YJD6C	I like how it fits around my ear, because I didn't want one of those ear buds with the mic dangling. This one is also nice because there's a button by the mic to push to hang-up calls or answer.  Great price. Very pleased.
B0047YJD6C	I purchased this to use with a Spectra-link 6020 phone which has the 2.5mm plug.  Surprisingly good sound quality out of this headset and good voice pick up.  The mute button works well.  There is also a switch that if turned on (Red indicator showing), it reroutes the sound back to the phone without having to unplug the headset.  Well worth the money so far.  We'll see the longevity as I purchased these for a business warehouse environment.
B004JU0E3K	The Philips SHE800/28 headphone is a very good product. I first purchased the headphones bc I need another pair to listen to my music as I work out but then once I had used them, I realized that I had gotten more than I was expecting. I am around a lot of noise through out the day for my job so when I work out I like to listen to my music and that is all. These headphones are very good at blocking out the back ground noise around you. Im able to listen to just my music and not have to hear anyone else talking to each other on the sides. You would have to turn down your music to really listen to someone around you. It also puts out very good quality sound as well. I have already talked a few of my friend into purchasing the same headphones. A good product for a good prices.
B004JU0E3K	I wanted a new and "improved" pair to rotate out my four-year old cheap but trusty Skull Candy buds that I've only used plugged into my office computer: the right wire connection is spotty from rolling away in my desk chair and yanking it from my ear so often! I've been test driving these Philips SHE800 at work as well as commuting with my Droid. I chose them thinking Philips was a generally reliable brand and I didn't want to splurge for $50+ fancy ones (beats audio or noise canceling, bass enhancing, etc.)...yet. The only advantages are that they look nice (coordinate with my Droid - vain but useless), fit comfortably, and have a nice rubbery tangle-resistant cord. Unfortunately, I thought I might like the turbo bass air vents and noise isolation features on these, but I'm disappointed. The air vents pick up wind, the bass does not sound significantly richer to me, the noise isolation makes ambient noise sound muffled and muddy (especially compared to the SC buds), and the cord transfers a lot of thumping (like a toy stethoscope) from movement, so they're no good for activity. If I had it to do over, I would not get these again.
B004JU0E3K	the bass is good but the music sounds HORRIBLE there is not detail no soundstage no imagery or any quality at all in these trash earphones!
B004JU0E3K	Great sound, as good as any of the other brands.  They are a little bigger than the other Phillips products.  I love the wire they use.  It doesn't get all hard from the oils from your skin.
B004JU0E3K	Got these for my mom since she needed new headphones that stay in better. She really liked them. Stay in her ear and they sound nice!
B004JU0E3K	These ear buds are good for the price. They have amazing sound quality for being only $20. The bass is very deep and strong. Good mids/highs. The tips are very comfortable, I can even sleep with these things in and not even know. The only thing lacking with these ear buds is the build quality. They come apart after a couple months. First the silver little plate thing on my left ear bud fell out and I had to glue it back and the rubber cords can get pretty tangled if you just put it into your pocket. I would consider buying the metal SHE9000 for better build quality.
B004JU0E3K	I was so sick of buying $5-10 headphones that always broke, so after my previous pair broke, I decided to do my research first. I'm a poor student, so my limit was $40...no Shures or Bose for me. I'm familiar with brands like Sony and JVC through their other products, but I've never had any luck with headphones (too flimsy for my use). I bought these almost a year ago (at list price, from Target), and I am extremely pleased. This brand, and this model in particular, were reviewed as being much more reliable than other common brands, and my experience supports that. Plus, the company offers a warranty for registering your headphones on their website. I'm used to replacing earbuds every few months, so for them to have lasted a year with no problems is amazing -- especially since the only reason I need new ones is because I lost my old ones last week!
B004JU0E3K	They sound really good. The plugs are a little big so they tend to come out a little much. But all in all, I am very pleased with them.
B004JU0E3K	I had headphones that broke so i was in need of some quick. I decided to look in amazon. I found these for a good price. When these came i tried them out they were awesome. I strongly suggest this to other people.
B004JU0E3K	For some cheap headphones. these thing really sound good. The bass isn't great if your a bass head though. Would recommend for the price.
B004JU0E3K	These headphones were great! They come with three different squishy ear buds. Your ears will be happy!!! NO annoying ringing sounds. Most importantly, the base is great!! Buy them...
B004JU0E3K	falls out of my ears constantly. even with all the different sized earbuds. i tried them all to no avail
B004JU0E3K	amazing sound quality...I had another pair that lasted 2 years and that's with me running 6 miles a day with them. I have been very impressed and satisfied with them.
B004JU0E3K	Great for price. The bass hits hard and great highs as well. If you like bass and dont want to spend $100 on ibeats then this is for you.
B004JU0E3K	I listen to a lot of audiobooks and with these headphones I often heard static - very annoying.  The static also ruined my music.  They didn't stay in my ears well, and the wires stuck to each other like there was static electricity making them cling to each other so they were always getting tangled.  Not happy at all with this purchase.  Got myself another pair - JVC HAFX1X Headphone Xtreme-Xplosivs - which I love.
B004JU0E3K	Bought these to replace nearly 8 yr old Phillips ear buds which had some cutting in/out due to wire issues The sound is really decent for the current price of just under $10.4 stars because of the fit. I put the smallest set of tips on and tried it... still tight. Disclaimer, I am a woman and I have small ears in general.I think its due to the core of the tip being so firm, so even though the outside is soft they don't squeeze down as well. I plan on using my old tips because they're much softer. I understand the point is probably some sort of noise cancelling feature, but they're uncomfortable to me to use for that reason.Overall good quality, and after my last ear buds lasted so long I'm looking forward to using these.
B004JU0E3K	These are the WORST headphones I've ever bought.  I was a big fan of an older line of Philips headphones that were discontinued in the last year or two.  I've tried two other "replacement" models and neither were as good as the old ones.  But these are the absolute WORST headphones that I didn't get for free with my phone/mp3 player/etc.  I can't believe they charged me for these!!!!  Used them for 10 seconds and they're going back!I used them on my new iPhone 4S and turned the bass way up, but still no bass.  They sound very tinny.  Yet the package says "Superior bass" on the front - what a joke.  There were 3 reviews for this product and they all had 5 stars.  What were you guys listening to?  AM radio?  These are the LAST Philips headphones I buy!Don't waste your time!
B004JU0E3K	One day at work my old headphones broke and I wanted to listen to music while I went home, so I started searching for headphones. I saw these and they were advertised as "Pump up the bass'' on the cover. Now personally, I love using headphones with a pumped up bass because I like the "kick" it provides for certain types of genre I listen to. So I decided to pick these up. These personally cost me 30 bucks. I've owned 13 dollars Philips headphones with extra bass and those were extrodinary, so I had high hopes for these since they were more than double the price of my old ones. Now I will be breaking this review up in Categories so it's easier to understand and hopefully it helps you make your decision.Sound - Well, let's just say I was dissapointed. I personally listen to a lot of rock and metal, and for every song the singing/instruments weren't very clear. It seemed as if the bass was too high but not in a good way, and the dissapointing part was the kicks from drumming had no kick feel to it. When I listened to Metal/Hip-Hop/Dubstep, the bass drops were fairly weak. I know this is a pair of 20 dollar headphones now, but let's face it when Philips offer headphones for 13 dollars (probably 5 bucks on amazon) that can provide a sick amount of bass with thump and clarity, these should be performing better, because I have no clue how a much more expensive product under perform compared to a cheap everyday pair of headphones from the same company.Comfort - These are fairly comfortable. If your someone who needs headphones for their computer/laptop/tablets, these are comfy. However, if your someone thats always on the run or need a pair for the gym, avoid this. These headphones stay in-ear wonderfully you are sitting down or just relaxing but if your constantly moving or working out, these will fall out every 5 mins. I live in NYC and I take the train to work everyday for about 30 mins and everytime I am walking I have to push these back in my ears because they tend to slowly come out, and it gets really frustrating after a while.Overall, not a bad pair of headphones, BUT there are many better ones out there and one of them happens to be a cheaper alternative from the same company. I do not know the exact model number but on the packaging it is titled as "extra bass headphones".  Hopefully I helped! let me know if you have any questions or comments. Thank you!
B004JU0E3K	For what I paid for these earbuds, no complaints. If you like your music on the bassy side, these are the buds to go with.The treble is muted slightly, but not real bad.
B0061KRKCE	This is perfect for people who prefer the feel of the old style handsets of old phones. Grandma LOVES it!
B0061KRKCE	As stated in title, this gift if awesome.  Not only is it a fun novelty gift, it actually works!  I bought 2 originally, ended up buying 3 more
B0061KRKCE	Love my receiver.  I dare holding cell phones when I talk on them. Wonderful happy excellent awesome.  What a treat.
B0061KRKCE	It doesn't work.. I plugged it in phone and heard complete silence.. I was very disappointed.. Couldn't hear nothing from it..
B0061KRKCE	Fit some cell phones but didn't fit mine. Took some time to adjust volume level so static would not be present.
B006ARM1WM	Great sound and very well made. I got the first set with my Galaxy Note II, and now want another set for travelling
B006ARM1WM	I was a little disappointed in the sound quality, it's good, but not the great sound quality I have come to expect from Samsung. The in-line mic was cool, but it did have a lot of background noise. The buds themselves were a little too big and I couldn't find a size that would fit my ear and not fallout. I would say I didn't like them, but with a price like this I can't really be too disappointed. If you're looking for some earbuds, but don't want to spend a lot of money, these are a decent choice.
B006ARM1WM	Considering the price, I was shocked at the sound quality that I got on these. Very comfortable (Samsung seems to be leaning towards the larger form fitting). They don't slip out which is why I replaced my iPhone buds in the first place. The other end can hear me even with my car window cracked open, and the audio quality is great when I'm at my desk at work. Unbeatable at their price level.
B006ARM1WM	These are without a doubt the best earbuds I've ever had. They are comfortable, they stay in, and they sound great.
B006ARM1WM	So glad I bought this and not any of the cheap versions out there.Came in the original sealed box and sound quality is very good.
B006ARM1WM	Well. This is very basic level sound performance. I expected it to be better as I they are Samsung originals but now I think I should have rather go for the cheaper ones. I will update my review once I order cheap ones and compare the two.Bass is OK. There was also some disturbance in the background of some sort.Although they are comfortable and fit well in the ear, they don't feel the same as the first ones.
B006ARM1WM	Best I ever say is 4 stars unless it was extraordinary. Yes buy them if you want them, there are certainly more expensive earbuds that aren't any better.
B006ARM1WM	The earbuds have great sound quality. When on a call, the person on the other end reported that they heard me better with the earbuds than without, however there was significant background noise heard. I was also able to hear the person I called better with the headset, although there was some static when the caller spoke. It's great that the headset comes with three different size eargels. Even though I don't usually like this type of head set, they still do not make a size that fits my abnormally small ears. The answer button is a great feature that is very useful. It made it quick and easy to answer and end calls. The packaging was easy to open with good details of the product.
