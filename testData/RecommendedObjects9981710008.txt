B002N2T3M4	I purchased this to use mainly in my vehicle to charge my HTC EVO 4G and to connect my phone to my computer. I mean its only a cord so you can't say too much, but I haven't had any issues with it what so ever. It works great as a charger and also works when I connect it to my computer.
B002N2T3M4	I bought this cable in the hopes of making contact backups from my LG LX290. Connecting to a PC results in the phone charging, which is good. It also sends the phone to a "USB mode" but the only available options are 1)Phone as modem 2)Print to Pictbridge.Clearly, some sort of special software on the PC end is required for making backups. None was included with the cable, and I could not find anything online. My only hope at this point is 1)I didn't look hard enough 2)Someone out there adds support for this phone in Bitpim.Can't complain too much since it's $3.50 out of my pocket, but still disappointing.
B002N2T3M4	I bought this cable for my LG GR500 Xenon, but it did not work. When I plug it onto my phone it beeps, indicating its plugged in, but then beeps again, indicating its disconnected. I have tried everything to make this cable work, but its no use.
B002N2T3M4	Don't use. My phone ended up being the problem for my computer not reading the music into mp3's.
B002N2T3M4	Had no problem with this order, item in good condition, nice to know a jump on Amazon.com can supply that odd or needed computer accessory that goes kaput or ends up where all the socks go!
B002N2T3M4	Came with a CD with some software that I didn't try or expected.  I only needed the cable.
B002N2T3M4	Worked as needed, only cost about .50 cents and shipping.Great deal - no longer have my LG phone but it was def. worth it, wayy cheaper than buying the $40.00 cord from the LG store.
B002N2T3M4	bought the cable to replace the broken stock one and it works great still to this day. the flexibility of the cable allows me to loosely wind it up on itself to store it in my pocket without issues.
B002N2T3M4	For 46 cents, and it does what it's supposed to do, ya just can't beat it!!
B00301MQAS	I got my Canon EOS Rebel at Costco a few years ago and lost the USB.  This worked perfectly as a replacement, and I have faith it will last for years to come.  For the price, I'd get another just to have handy.  No complaints.
B00301MQAS	I can never seem to find my cord for my Canon Rebel when I'm ready to transfer pictures.  So, I ordered 2 of these cords.  I've left one in my office and one at home.  Hopefully I can always find one now.  I've used both cords and they get the job done.
B00301MQAS	I had lost my USB cable for my Canon Rebel DSLR camera and needed a replacement to move pictures onto my tablet while traveling.  This USB cable is exactly what I wanted!
B00301MQAS	The one that came with my camera broke and I couldn't download my photos.  This one works great.  It was a good price too.
B00301MQAS	I was not sure if this would work for the price but I was able to transfer pictures just fine
B00301MQAS	I lost my original cables and this does the same job as a pair I had bought before in Best buy for $29.  Great value for the money and use for this cable. I always find best prices in Amazon.
B00301MQAS	It was good to find this cable since the camera has been replaced by newer models lately.  The cable works great and eliminates the need of removing the memory card when doing a file transfer.The seller was spot on - great price, good packaging and very prompt shipment.
B00301MQAS	As described - it is a cord.  works as described what more can I say about it in 10 more words?
B00301MQAS	This cable works just as great as the original cable that came with the camera. I saved a ton of money by ordering this instead of the canon brand original.
B00301MQAS	It works perfectly for my Canon Rebel XS!! I was a tad nervous, it it was cheap and works fine!
B00301MQAS	I bought six of these cables for my yearbook class and three months later, only two remain operable.  The first two never worked, and the two remaining are slow and unreliable.  Ironically, there are much better cables out there for not much more money:Power Supply :) USB Cable Lead Cord for Vtech V Tech Kidi Zoom Digital Camera, Kidizoom Pro, Plus - Childrens Kids Multimedia Digital USB Cable for Picture Transfer.  DON'T buy this one!
B00301MQAS	The plastic on the end the fits into the camera was slightly too large for the area the Rebel offers me to fit the plug into.  With some jiggling (and a little force) it fit into place.  That was my only concern.
B00301MQAS	It arrived on time, was a great price, it fit and it does the job.  The download seemed slow, but I have only used it on my older computer, but that is what I bought it for because my new computer has a card reader. I really don't have any other option, so, I am happy that it does what it is supposed to do.
B00301MQAS	Have never gotten it to work with Canon Rebel.  Did what I was told to do, but it is useless to me.
B004ZIQ98U	Had for some time now.  Holds up better than the really cheap cables.  Happy with my purchase Thanks 55
B004ZIQ98U	The cable arrived neatly packaged in a small plastic sack. It *appears* to be an actual OEM cable, with identical look and feel to the original that came with the phone, and what looks like a legitimate HTC logo on the tag.I purchased this cable for my daughter because the insulation on her original had separated from the plug a bit on the phone side, so the ground/shielding was exposed. And after about a week... the same happened to the new cable, but worse. So assuming similar levels of daily abuse, this cable is either not as real as it looks, or HTC just doesn't make a good cable. The latter does not seem far-fetched based on our experience with the phone itself.
B004ZIQ98U	I've tried the cheaper cables for my HTC Incredible II and they ended up breaking my USB connector.  This cable is a good quality and so far has been charging my phone without problems.  Other cables would also effect how my touch screen responded if I used my phone while it was charging, not this one.
B004ZIQ98U	Item shipped in retail packaging. The cord works great and the HTC tag on the cable looks like the real deal, unlike some of the knock offs I have seen pictures of.
B004ZIQ98U	I lost my original cable and ordered this for use with HTC Thunderbolt and Kindle Fire data transfers. It also works as a charger with the little piece.
B005Q6TWA2	Love this product, the only thing that made me sad was I lost one of them :(, but this product is adorable and helps me keep my headphones organized and compact!
B005Q6TWA2	Too cute.  Works well.  Love them!
B005Q6TWA2	First of all it's extremely cute, the details on the eyes and nose are great. The only thing painted on is the red collar. The eyes and nose don't look like they will fall or rub off. The collar looks painted well, but done well. So the overall cat won't deteriote the more you use it. The button attaches really strongly and doesn't look like it will loosen, or fall apart easily with a slight tug.The size is perfect, as in it wraps around the cable well and is not short that you can't button the ends. Overall, I love this little adorable thing and I don't mind seeing its face everyday. It's sturdy, works, and it's cute.I would recommend this to anyone who leaves everything uncoiled in their drawer like I do.
B005Q6TWA2	This product is seriously cute, but I have received this broken. The click button on the unit is very very weak.
B005Q6TWA2	Really cute and lovely. It was arrived so fast!It's really cute. If it was a bit cheaper, I would have bought more than a pair.
B005Q6TWA2	adorable and wonderful! bought in memory of my first kitty, Kid.i use it on my galaxy s5 charger cord. i wouldn't suggest anything larger than a phone cord here, if you have large HDMI cords look into velcro straps. there's a package of 100 on amazon for under $4 that work great.
B005Q6TWA2	Received two black cat button cable winders. They are great for not only iPhone cords but for camera cords too.
B007EN8AVM	The ifrogz USB cable is the perfect length. Variety of colors to choose from. Had fast shipping and would definitely buy more if needed. And as for the people saying it stops working...so far mine has been better than any other USB cord that I have bought. Charges my phone fast.
B007EN8AVM	Great blend of quality / price.  This is the third one I've bought (all still working, just need a bunch to keep the whole family happy) and not been disappointed.  Color even lets us know whose is whose!Solid connectors, decent weight, just works.  Not as cheap as some, but higher quality than everything at the price.
B007EN8AVM	I ordered three of these cords and just love them.  I like the colors because they are always easy to find, and I know which cords are mine...
B007EN8AVM	This product lasts so much longer than the cords they give you with the phone. Love it.  Own it in many colors.
B007EN8AVM	I got this to replace a cheap cable I got from Walmart with a Just Wireless 2 USB input car charger. This is a very good quality cable, the prongs on the micro end don't recess into plug like cheaper versions, & the joints between the cable & connectors are durable. I highly recommend.
B007EN8AVM	Alot of reviews said they stopped working, well mine is working fine so far. No problems what so ever. Hopefully it will last awhile.
B007EN8AVM	I've used a bunch of different cables while charging my android phone but all of them were slow. I didn't know they were slow until a friend lent me his iFrogz cable and my phone charged up quickly. Then I did a test and found the iFrogz cable charges everything (tables, etc.) quickly! Plus it's a very sturdy cable and I like that it comes in so many colors.I suggest you buy this cable as you won't be disappointed with it.
B007KX7CX8	I bought two of these cables. Both of them were broken within a week. Maybe it's a fluke, but take caution.
B007KX7CX8	I liked the cable because of its length primarily (and because white is slightly more exciting than the usual drab black you get as an accessory with your phone), and it does its job (I've only ever used it to charge a phone). However after using it for about a month and a half it started slipping out of my phone's mini USB port all the time, which - especially if it goes unnoticed - is quite annoying, if you have to make sure it's in there all the time. Moving the phone while it's plugged in became just impossible. I haven't seen this with any of the other cables I have around (and I use them for about equal amounts of time if not longer).
B007KX7CX8	This cable is so convenient to charge while I am using my phone / tablet.  The 6 foot cord means that it will not snag as I move around with the device.
B007KX7CX8	I should have gotten a longer cord, but otherwise it is wonderful.  I wake up in the morning my phone is fully charged.  It is not slow to charge like I have seen with other cords.  It is good quality and fits the micro USB on my phone perfect.  I have a case on my phone and the casing around the micro USB of the cord is not too bulky where it interferes with charging.
B007KX7CX8	great length, good quality cable, plug seems to be not good quality as it became loose (doesn't stick in like when it was new) bought from case star
B007KX7CX8	I bought 6 of these after buying a galaxy note 2. These cables on the 2.0Amp wall charger that came with the note takes twice as long to charge compared to the cable that came with the note. It also takes forever to copy data over. I am giving these two stars because they are a good build quality.
B007KX7CX8	This item is good for the price and serves the purpose of allowing me to use my Samsung connector plug in and I would definitely recommend this item.
B007KX7CX8	LOVE THIS CABLE....IT IS MUUCH LONGER THAN THE ONE THAT COMES WITH THE CELLPBOHE AND IT IS OF A GREAT QUALLITY. LOE IT AN WILL PROBABLY BUY 3 OR 4 MORE.
B007KX7CX8	This cord works well so far. Sometimes inexpensive cords are flimsy and loose fitting. This one seems pretty robust and works perfectly.
B007KX7CX8	The USB Data Sync Charging Cable charges just fine with no issues.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a 'white' cord.
B007KX7CX8	I got two of these for use with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  The cable seems to work fine for charging (both via usb computer and direct AC outlet using adapter) and transfers - no issues.  The length is good and the fit into my phone seems snug and just right.  No complaints - I would order again.
