B002CSIXX4	Nice phone cover, durable and decorative. Have dropped it and it did not break.  Great to have to protect the phone itself, a very good buy for the price - these are alot more expensive at the mall or at the phone stores.
B002SV5OI2	I ordered this mainly to get the car and wall chargers for my HTC Touch Pro 2. The chargers given in the pack (Cellet mini USB Travel/Home Charger and CyonGear car charger) were standard mini-usb and did not fit my Touch Pro 2's proprietary plugin as I expected. It looks like they threw this together assuming the phone used the standard usb plugin without testing it.The car holder looks to be made for an iPod, but it's adjustable and fits the phone fine and sturdy. I have yet to try mounting it in my car.The leather case is decent, with a magnetic latch. The screen protectors (Luxmo) are fine.
B003VRY2SA	The big screen is nice bit it comes with a price.  Constant dead battery. I wish I never got it.
B003VRY2SA	I've had my Droid X for 3 years, I love it.  I did put a Liberty ROM on it and therefore got rid of all the bloatware and only have apps I use.  My battery life is good when WIFI is off.  At the end of the day, I have between 15% and 75% battery life left, depending on how much I've been using it.  Love the big screen, it is responsive and sturdy.  Even after all this time, it is like new.
B004BW0602	This case is by far the worst protection for  my phone. I ended up throwing it away because it is too floppy and doesn't work when you try to put it in your pocket. Don't waste your money on it, I wish I would have checked it out before buying the one I got.
B004BW0602	The myTouch 4G is a bit thin and slick.  This case cover makes the myTouch 4G easier to hold because it does add some thickness as well as providing a more secure grip.The color makes it easy to find the phone in my black purse.It's also very easy to remove this case if I want to put my phone in a different slide-in holster on my waistband.Great price, too.
B004BW0602	This item is exactly what it says. It works great and was a really good price when I bought it (not sure what it is now). I wish it were maybe slightly thinner, like some expensive ones in the stores, but that probably just means better protection.
B004BW0602	LOVE this phone cover the price is great!! This thing has help up great been using mine for a year now looks new. I have dropped my phone tons of times and it really does help to protect the face.
B004FOT9IG	I got these cases a few days ago and have since packed them up and sent them back. They are a terrible fit on my droid 2 global. You slide out the keyboard and the face cover doesn't stay on, it feels loose all the way around, They are cheap and flimsey and not at all worth the money. I will spend a little extra and get a better case.
B0062CU0PK	Thought that it would be softer like the silicone cases. I thought it was one piece but they go together very snug, almost impossible to remove without nicking up. I ended up ordering 3, only wanted 2. One like this and a blue one to protect and distinguish one phone from another. Must have added 2x when adding the blue one to the cart. I still love them and the price was so great will keep the extra one. Placed order on 12/9 and received 12/17, to be expected. Very happy with the product and cost was very affordable for me.
B0062CU0PK	Fits how it should, doesnt look like plastic, and design is even prettier in person. It protects my phone well and goes nicely with all of my outfits.
B0062CU0PK	Very pleased with the cover and purchase. The designs are very unique and tasteful in my own opinion. Thank you
B006MWOTM0	The sync portion of the cradle works great.  I can't seem to get the battery charging portion to work however.  Is there a trick?
B006MWOTM0	I needed to replace my OEM BB charging pod that stopped working, and I also needed to get a new battery, so figured instead of getting a separate spare battery charger, I would get this.  After having it for a couple of hours,  it will no longer charge the phone,  and I know why,  its a very tight fit and you have to push down on the phone to get it to go on the charging port.  Well after a few times, the USB charger port moves up and down, not sure it is still connected to anything inside, I cant it to go all the in to phones charger port, so I have no idea if it will still charge.I am going to return it, and find something else, I think.
B006MWOTM0	this is a great stand and there are several other usage for this stand,due to the fact that this stand can be used a a stand in USB port for your blackberry is awesume, absolutley great for the price!!!!!!!
B006MWOTM0	This is a great docking station for my phone. I have had it now for about a month I figured i would wait before posting a review on it. First off shipping was super fast on this item. I have had no issues using it either. It charges my phone with ease.  I can plug it either in the wall or on my computer. Right now I am using it by my bedside.
B0076WV01I	I feel like not using my wallet and having this has been so beneficial. You and fit probably 3 bils in the inside and 4-5 cards. I've had it for a month i believe and some piece of the plastic broke, but it didn't really make a difference. I'm very happy with it though, for the price of the product it's a great item. It also doesn't feel cheap at all, other than the plastic, but that's it.
B0076WV01I	I got the wallet case cover for the HTC sensation not too long ago and I like it a lot.  It carries no more than 4 cards which suits me just fine.  I notice that cards can get stuck no and again but it's not a big deal.  At the price and free shipping, it's a great deal.
B0076WV01I	Totally satisfied.Don't put too much money or cards inside, or else it'll expand and won't hold.In the whole, the phone becomes quite thick, so make sure you'll have enough space in your pocket.
B0076WV01I	This is the perfect case for those get up and go days when you don't want to carry a purse. Credit card slots are perfect and even a side pouch for some dollar bills. It fits the T-Mobile Sensation like a glove...
B0076WV01I	it was what i expected ! so i like this product .....thanks a lot . it;s perfect for my phone
B0076WV01I	fits everything. really handy when you don't feel like bringing a whole wallet when you're just running a quick errand.
B0076WV01I	Beautiful design, multi-purpose(can use as a wallet as well), and the phone nicely fits in. Overall very satisfied. The only issue could be removing the phone from the case since it's kinda tight  but it shouldn't be a problem when done carefully.
B0076WV01I	Like this product keeps phone safe and just enough space for cards and money. I would recommend this to any one
B0076WV01I	Nice enough case, fake leather, but a nuisance to have to take it off in order to charge the phone.
B0076WV01I	Exactly what I was looking for... has lasted for some time now and really is very functional! Wish I found less boy styles and more girly ones :-)
B0076WV01I	The leather case leaves sheen on the screen.  Have to wipe off numerous times during the day.  Uncomfortable holding it up to hear.
B0076WV01I	my sister has the same phone htc sensation and she took it away from me she is crazy about it but rather use pouch.
B0076WV01I	The leather wallet is fine, however I'm a little disappointed that the plastic part that holds the phone in place has already broken.  The thin piece of plastic by the volume button has completely snapped off.  The wallet still keeps the phone in place.  I guess I shouldn't expect more considering the price point was very inexpensive.
B0076WV01I	I bought this for my husband's new phone...it is convenient and he has not lost his phone, but he did crack the screen.
B0076WV01I	Durable and useful.protects the phone, and provides a great space for emergency cash.The black color makes it stylish, and the design is clean and simple.
B0076WV01I	Bought this case for my fiance who does not like to carry around a purse and would always leave her ID and cards in a friends purse or misplaced around the house. She loves this case, which holds her phone and case perfectly and the leather is not shabby, and always has her essentials with her.
B0076WV01I	I love this product! Received it in less than 5 days. Immediately started using it. It is really good for those days when you don't want to carry anything too heavy (I use it everyday). You have to take the phone out to charge or to get a comfortable grip when texting horizontally, but I don't mind. Just wish they had other colors!
B0076WV01I	I was either forgetting my phone or my wallet, because I'm stubborn and hate purses (and lady pants just don't have the required pocket space), so I thought that this case would be the perfect solution. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, so when I saw the price, I figured I'd give it a shot.The phone fits well, and is easy to remove. I can fit my license, credit card, building ID badge, insurance card, a little cash in it (and by a little cash, I mean like a single bill). That is really pushing it to its capacity, which is made obvious by the fact that the seams in the wallet pockets are all ripped. But like I said, I barely paid anything for this, and I've been pretty abusive with putting cards in it. Everything still stays in place, so I'm not worried about losing any cards from the ripped seams. If you just want an ID card and credit card, you'd be golden. Also, the screen protector was a nice little bonus.I've used this wallet case every day for the past 6 months and it's in good enough shape to keep using - the outside still looks like new. If you are constantly losing your wallet/phone, this might not be the best thing to get (having your phone, ID, credit card/money stolen together would suck), but if you keep everything in your purse anyway, I don't really see the concern. I am really happy I stumbled across this case, it's kept everything I need together.
B0076WV01I	The phone keeps falling out of the holder? The case is exactly what I ordered and the condition is great, but that was only problem I had.
B0076WV01I	Just like the picture all black wallet with brown stitching.  The only thing I disliked about the product, is the screen protector supplied doesn't cover the screen completely leaving the bottom buttons uncovered.
B0076WV01I	I do not recommend to buy this product. I did love it at first but the inside seam that holds all the credit cards starting taring and it no longer holds the credits fall out. I tried returning it but never got a response back.
