B000N247ZE	I bought this for my Nokia 6275i and it works great!!!! transfer stuff from my computer to phone in the flash...
B000N247ZE	USB data sync Cable for Nokia phone did not work Vendor never responded to product not working.
B000N247ZE	Decent quality. Most definitely better than a few I have ordered but nothing too great about it. Would order again if needed.
B000N247ZE	The description of the product suggests that the cable supports FBUS but in fact this is not an FBUS cable.
B000N247ZE	Works great and I found it here for less than 10 dollars. Great value.. on Cellphone store its at 30 to 50 dollars.
B000N247ZE	I was shopping around for this cable at the mall and they wanted $32 for it and I thought personally that was a little to steep. After doing some research for this cable online I found it at amazon for just over $5 and shipping costs just over $4. So all together it came out to be just a little over $10 what a substantial about of savings. Not only the savings , but the cable works great. I can say I am VERY SATISFIED with this product. Thanks Amazon!
B000N247ZE	very good it just doesn't charge your phone like the other ones do when its hooked up
B000N247ZE	wored perfect on my phone I was able to put my own stuff on there without paying gor tones,wallpaper etc if you got the 2865i I you got to have this it got here in 2 days in standard shipping thats great
B000N247ZE	This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesn't easily clip into the phone, you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it.
B003WU2UIA	cable did not transfer data.  I downloded software to transfer data and it still did not work.  i am unhappy with your service
B003WU2UIA	happy happy happy good and very affordable.
B003WU2UIA	It fits slightly tighter than the charger plug that came with the phone, but works well to transfer ringtones and music from my computer.  Well worth it!
B003WU2UIA	We use this to play our DVDS or streamed music from our laptop...works great!!!!  Cord is springy so we can leave it attached to TV
B003WU2UIA	The USB Data Cable for the Samsung Rugby phone works as it says it will. Transfers Photo's and Charge the battery also. You won't find this cheaper for the price it's worth it.
B003WU2UIA	I needed to retrieve pictures off an old Rugby phone that was broken, (yes, they break!!) This cable worked so I could hook it up to a computer and get them.
B0051HTUSA	I bought 10 of these and they're good for a short time, I just wish it lasted longer than a month or two. It's usually the end that connects to your iphone that breaks gets a short or comes apart. But even if it only lasts a short while, it's definitely worth the money.
B0051HTUSA	After 4 months, 4 out of 5 are now not working.  One of them was dead right out of the package.  I would not recommend these.
B0051HTUSA	Writing this about a week after receiving the product.The product was exactly as pictured and advertised. As a similar design as the actual Apple cable, it is better than other products I have used which have a bulkier media house that didn't quite fit. These work and fit well. The one true test left is how well it wears.Based on my experience so far, I would use this vendor/product again.
B0051HTUSA	Quality, quantity, and look at the price!  This pack is a great deal and I would definitely buy again.  As long as I make sure I charge with the 10V wall charger, my iPad charges up nicely and I don't have to sit awkwardly near the nearest outlet.
B0051HTUSA	I put a few of these in each of my kids stockings for Christmas.  It's so great to have a longer iphone cord!
B0051HTUSA	These cords are exactly what I ordered and expected, they look like good quality so for the price, this was a 5 star transaction. Shipping was quick too so maybe 5+ star rateing.
