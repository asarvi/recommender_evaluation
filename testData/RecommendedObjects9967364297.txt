B000LET7FY	I bought "NEW Home Charger Cell Phone for Samsung SCH-u650 Sway"NEW Home Charger Cell Phone for Samsung SCH-u650 SwayOn the very first use, after the phone was fully charged, my wife attempted to unplug the charger from the wall outlet.  She pulled it straight out from the wall, pulling on the adapter body (NOT THE CORD) as you should.  The bottom plate seperated and an arc-flash ensued.  Needless to say, she is upset after the close call and possibility of electrocution.  I examined the device and although I did discover a single screw in the bottom plate,...  there was no corresponding socket for it to thread into.  That's right, the screw was met by unobstructed open space, therefore it was holding nothing.  I guess you get what you pay for.  By the way, I worked professionally in the electricity and electronics fields since 1977.  I know a manufacturer's defect when I see it, especially one of this magnitude.
B000LET7FY	It is a nice and very light and easy to use charger. Bought it for an extra to leave at mountain property so I didn't have bring the one at home back and forth. I think I will use this one to leave at home and take the older one to the property because I like it better then the one that came with the phone.
B000LET7FY	This charger works just great and at the price, I just leave it in my travel bag so it's always with me when I am on the road.
B000LET7FY	I didn't think it'd be brand new since it was so cheap, but it was fresh when i received it!
B000LET7FY	Although the manufacturer said it would accommodate my phone, it did not. Threw it away and bought ght out a $5.00 charger from a vendor on a street corner in /Manhattan
B000LET7FY	This charger was a good price and it worked very well.  It seemed to do the job however, I would have liked a longer cord. I would recommend purchasing this charger.
B000LET7FY	This a great charger. It works perfectly well. I'm very happy with this and would highly recommend it to others.
B000LET7FY	It's a perfectly functional charger, no complaints. But be advised that this thing has a VERY BRIGHT light that turns on when it's plugged in.
B000LET7FY	I got this case for my daughter's video iPod.  It is adorable, it fits great and is durable.  She is 9 and is able to take it off and on by herself. No rips or tears in doing so.  It is easy to put on, but harder to take off.The shipping is very fast and efficient.  In fact, after we received the first one, we went back and bought another!
B000LET7FY	so after getting this item the casing on it came apart, and i ended up electrocuting myself. it was an easy fix though. i used some electrical tape to hold the cover to the part that plugs into the wall (super glue might have done the trick as well). and it works great now. i would have given it a 5 star, but after falling apart and the accident, i decided on 4. it is cheaply made, but what else would you expect from a $3 charger. it fits the samsung phone perfectly and other than that ive had no problems with it. but then again i have only owned it for about 2-3 weeks now. i recommend if you get this item to secure the two pieces together before using it.  good thing is after electrocuting myself the item still works and it didnt give a shortage to the circuit breakers.
B000LET7FY	awesome charger, i bought this for my grandmother after i accidentally broke hers, it was soo much cheaper theen the one that verizon was trying to sell me
B000P257EC	Dead on arrival.  Smells like cigarettes.  Strongly suspect it's actually used or refurbished.  It's too cheap ($5) to bother with an exchange, which is probably the key to their business model.
B000P257EC	This product works great. Everything I expected! I will order again in the near future. And have a nice day
B000P257EC	I chose this but received a different model but what I received is serviceable.  I don't rate stuff normally. But I am being cooperative.
B000P257EC	Motorola RAZR V3 KRZR K1m RIZR Z3 Home AC Wall Travel Charger SPN5185The charger was very reasonably priced ($0.88 + $2.95 s/h); received well within a week; new condition; works as advertised.
B000P257EC	I needed a new charger to keep Krazr going for a while longer, works great, really good price and it shipped to me very quickly.Good Job!
B000P257EC	The shipping charge was more than the price of the product. Seems a bit excessive!!!
B000P257EC	This charger got here fast and in excellent condition i will defiantly be ordering from this seller again. However this charger is for the OLD razor not the new one, this was my mistake not the fault of the seller, just a warning for any one looking for a charger for the new razor this is not the right one!!!
B000P257EC	Best price around for a factory replacement. Just like the one that comes with your phone. Awesome deal.
B000P257EC	Our cats chewed up my husband's charger cord that came with the phone originally, and this was the perfect replacement.  It works perfectly, fits perfectly, no problems.  And CHEAP!
B000P257EC	I bought this to replace my broken Razr V3xx charger.This is an outstanding price for an OEM charger.Look no further because you wont find a better product or price.It fit a little akwardly(hard to get in completely) in the wall socket,but it fits the phone and works perfectly.I couldnt be more pleased.
B000P257EC	This was the first time I ordered anything online. The charger arrived on time and I did not have any problems with the charger. I also ordered a battery from the same company. It arrived at a  latter date because of the snow however, I saved over 100.00 by buying these products here appose to buying local.
B000P257EC	Seller shipped quickly and I received in good condition.  This charger works with the V3 phone, and it charges my Garmin Nuvi 255w too.  I have Moto branded adapter that steps the plug down to micro usb so I can use it to charge my new Droid.  I have several of these so I can drop my phone for charging anywhere I happen to be.
B000P257EC	This charger wouldn't charge my phone because Motorola puts a chip in the phones so you have to buy a charger from Motorola.The company that I got my charger from knew this are should have,now I have a useless charger so beware!!!!!!!!
B000PI38U6	the igo charger and tips has got to be the one of the best ideas. no one keeps the same phone forever, and the igo charger is adaptable to whatever phone you upgrade to. the a64 tip for the sony ericsson phones my wife and i have works even better than the sony ericsson car charger. i would recommend the igo charger and tips to anyone.
B000PI38U6	I've owned two of these and both have failed just after 6 months of use.  I've also purchased two tips for my iPod and two different iGo chargers... same story, all fail right after 6 months.  The build quality is poor and it appears that these simply are not designed for continual use.  I recommend choosing another product line.  iGo is marketing cheap parts perhaps with the understanding that you're changing your electronic device often enough to warrant new tips and/or charging sets.  If you change your phone or receiving device every six months, then this will suffice.  If you're interested in a quality product that will work reliably over time, then this is not a smart choice.
B000PI38U6	This certain cell phone charging tip is pretty hard to come by but love the ones I purchased from this website.  I purchased multiples so I can keep one at work, in the car, etc.
B000PI38U6	It works like it is supposed to work.
B000PI38U6	The tip connects to the cord securely, and to the phone.  Amazon's price was great.  I don't know what more I could want.
B000PI38U6	Fits the phone.  Fits the igo charger.  Charges the phone.  Not much more to say.
B000PI38U6	Not too much to say about this.  It works great for my Sony Ericsson phone with the rest of my iGo products.
B004SKBR78	it was an exact fit.  Came quick in the mail.  was really cheap.  Works like a charm. Would reccomenned to a friend.
B004SKBR78	Great Product It works with my phone and i use it at the office that is what is important to me.
B004SKBR78	Only gave 1 star and that is only because I received it quickly.  Does not work at all.  Tried several phones as sell as power outlets, and still nothing.
B004SKBR78	This is a great little charger.  The one that originally came with my phone was a piece of junk and never worked very well, so I was afraid maybe all the chargers for my phone weren't great--or that my phone needed to be replaced.  As soon as I plugged my phone in, it started charging without any problems.  It also charges more quickly than my old one (in about half the time).  I'm so glad I got this, and at such a low price.
B004SKBR78	perfect timing and perfect shape! Can't beat the cost either! Thank you so much! We needed one of these badly!
B005JZSW92	This charger works as expected. It is compact and light. The accompanying battery is a Nokia original. The lights displaying the charge status are accurate and nicely colored. If you try to charge a battery already full, it immediately displays this condition, saving you the time most others waste trying to charge the battery.
B005JZSW92	i wish it charged faster but who knows fro the future. i love my uni- charger. my life has been saved by this company. thank you much
B005JZSW92	I received these items on time. The first battery sent was defective and i contacted the seller about it and the seller was more than willing to send a new battery. The new battery is in order and i am happy with the performance of the new battery. It performs like an original battery, only that it has no seal but that is no problem to me. The battery has long life and the charger is so handy too !! I will definitely recommend !
B005JZSW92	Charger works well which is why I bought this in first place . I have the Nokia N900 which suffers from the usual miniusb port loose connections.  This charges the battery better than when the Nokia was new. Second battery has not held charge as well as factory battery.  that is the only reason for 4 stars.  the charger by itself is 5 stars.
B005JZSW92	Does what is intended for. I purchased as third battery and my life was changed from the beginning. I doesn't know what being offline is.
B005JZSW92	I've had this charger for several months, it charges my batteries (the one included with this external charger as well as the one included with the N900) to their full capacity.With the N900 this is almost a mandatory accessory, the N900 will have difficulty charging if you let it die, making the only way to bring functionality back to charge the battery with an external charger or in another phone.
B005JZSW92	The battery that comes with it is not so great though. It lasts only  a day or so. But as for not being original I guess it is expected. The charger is very cool on it's own. Gradual color change is really  very helpful.
B007DZS91M	my husbands phone wouldn't connect with the traditional charger anymore....so we purchased this external charging battery station and an extra battery and so is soo happy to have a charged phone...
B007DZS91M	This seemed like a good package deal.  The battery has worked fine but most do fo the same price.  The charger seemed a good bonus but did not charge consistently from the get-go.  After a month it simply stopped charging all together.  Also it took longer to arrive than I'd hoped, though not inconsistent with the disclosed shipping estimates.
B007DZS91M	Needed this because of the notorious problem w/ the mini usb jack on the phone. Did it's job, got me by a few months until my upgraded.
B007DZS91M	It was nice to have some options for charging .. The set works fine . And gets job done.. Good item
B007DZS91M	After determining that the charging port on my phone was broken, I ordered the external battery charger along with a few extra battery's. It's a minor inconvenience to swap battery's everyday, but worth it to continue using my HTC Incredible 2!
