B000J1E5M4	These charger are the same that would cost 2 to 3 times as much if purchased directly from Motorola or from one of the cell phone carriers. Just what I wanted - to have a second travel charger for my briefcase and the car charger to have in the car and not spend a bundle to do it.
B000J1E5M4	Beware of this item!  The description indicates that the home charger is 800Ma, but it is only a 200Ma item (the picture is correct).  At the lower rating, it is unable to charge many cell phones and is useless.
B000J1E5M4	OME Motorola. Great value. It just shows you how much stores rip you off.
B000J1E5M4	Have had no problems after a month of use.  Both chargers work fine for 2 different model motorola phones, including a RAZR. Also works fine with my tmobile MDA.
B000J1E5M4	2 piece combo: Home charger worked but car charger did not. Does not appear to be true Motorola products as stated in description. Car charger connection does not fit into the Motorola PEBL. I guess that's what I get for $5.99 plus shipping. It is hardly worth sending back. The shipping costs more than the chargers.
B000J1E5M4	The car charger is what I've used most often and it charges my phone efficiently. No issues at all so far. I've had the charger for about 6 months.

B004AZ6BX6	By no means do I depend on this to completely charge my phone.  However, it does keep my phone alive until I get to work, home, or friend's apartment.
B004AZ6BX6	perfect for me can charge my ipod,phone,and passangers phone all at once. no problems with it got here on time.
B004AZ6BX6	This car attachment is great. I like the extra usb ports and the open cigarette lighter outlet! Works great without a hitch!
B004AZ6BX6	This adapter is very sturdy, very good quality.  Very cheaply priced.  I would definately recommend and purchase again if required.
B004AZ6BX6	good product.. for a great price bought 2 one for me and one for wife car, would get this if you need usb car plugg
B004AZ6BX6	Do not buy until you know the output voltage and current of this charger and that of your phone/tablet. This charger has very low output power, even when only one device is connected. my blackberry charges fine while connected to the laptop using the same USB cable.Also do not buy from the sellers who charge high shipping and handling, becuase if you return the charger you won't get refund of the S/H charges. I suspect the sellers who price the item $1.50 with S/H of $3 do that purposefully because they know their product does not work and will likely be returned. Note down such sellers and never buy anything from them.
B004AZ6BX6	My car only has one DC outlet, and on a recent long trip with my dad we were able to charge both our smart phones at the same time. Connection light is helpful. No glitches whatsoever. Wish it was available in black.
B004AZ6BX6	Very glad i ordered this product it works great. Had one already liked it do much i ordered a second one
B004AZ6BX6	Build quality is good - product feels solid and works well.  Its size is a little bulky and cumbersome, or would have gotten five stars.UPDATED:  Even though this product isn't used very often, it has died in a short amount of time.  On my last trip out of town, I needed to charge my phone, and there is apparently an internal short in the device --it won't change my phone.  The fuse is good ... the light on the device comes on, but no power to the phone.  I guess in the end, you get what you pay for, and this was not a wise choice for me.
B004AZ6BX6	plugged it in and nothing...thought it killed my phone.  plugged my phone into the wall charger and nothing. took the battery off and waited 30 min. finally it startedto charge.
B004AZ6BX6	These car chargers are PERFECT. Everyone in the car gets to charge their phones AND light cigarettes!!I can't think of ANY complaints, and I LOVE to complain... :)
B004AZ6BX6	I have used this several times since I got this in Feb 2013. It works great whenever I need to use the GPS and need to charge the phone or camera. Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
B004AZ6BX6	I purchased this item about a month ago for use as a car charger for my phone and also be able to still use the outlet for my gps.  The charger works perfectly.  I have had my mytouch 4G an I-Phone 4 (work on call phone) and my gps all plugged into this at the same time and it has worked flawlessly to charge all 3 devices at the same time.  You need to provide your own usb cables, but that is ok since so many phones have different cables anyway.  The two phone I listed above have totally different connections.  Having the cords not included reduces the price anyways.
B004AZ6BX6	Once i got this item i was excited to use it, but when i first put it into my car, did not work for me
B004AZ6BX6	Works great, rugged construction.  Charges multiple items without problem.  I am very happy with this purchase.  I can now charge a phone and an ipod at the same time.
B004AZ6BX6	These are esasy to use without loosing you lighter plug like most. These have come in hady when freinds are in car and we need to charge several things a once.
B004AZ6BX6	I bought this to charge my netbook and phone at the same time.  It lasted one day before blowing out and becoming useless
B004I44CHQ	This was just what I needed!  The item described was the item I received!
B004I44CHQ	Happy with this unit, but can't confirm if the 2.1A Apple port truly provides that current. Nice bright blue light to indicate that it's powered up and ready to charge phones and tablets.
B004I44CHQ	The title states it all. Only charger I have found that can do both, well! A bit bulky but given the limited choices for what I need, very pleased!
B004I44CHQ	Works great with my Galaxy Note 10.1 and my Galaxy S III at the same time, charging both devices to full charge in the regular time, just like the original wall or car charger.
B004I44CHQ	It will charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet with no problems. It is not very heavy and stays in the dash charge receptacle. It even stays in while I am on bumpy country roads. Overall a good product.
B004I44CHQ	My older rocketfish charger I bought back when I had my OG Droid came out doesn't seem to charge my Galaxy Nexus. I ordered this and it charges my Galaxy Nexus on both the 2.1A and 1A. I am using this to charge both my Galaxy Nexus and Iphone 4S. I don't have a tablet, so I can't comment on that part.
B004I44CHQ	This device permits me to charge both tablet and phone (or keyboard) simultaneously. Just as the wall mountable unit, it provides 2.1 amps through the 'white' port, while also providing at least 1 amp through the 'black' port. I strongly recommend this unit - it is the ONLY one I've seen that is capable of charging both units simultaneously.
B004I44CHQ	Scosche seems to be one of the few brands that offers a dual-port usb car charger that goes up to 3 amps combined (2+1). Personally I needed it to charge both my Galaxy Note 2 (up to 1.7 amps) and my wife's Galaxy S3 (up to 1 amp) while we are on road trips together. The Note 2 chugs a lot of power particularly when doing GPS navigation, audio playback, etc..., so on lower-powered chargers (i.e. 750 milli-amps) the rate of battery drain is faster than the rate of charge. Not good, but this model promises to remedy that. It is made for Galaxy/Android devices specifically (hence the name) as compared to the Apple-based variant of this charger, which is important to know for compatibility.My review of this product in a nutshell is: yes, it delivers a full 2 amps of power through one USB port. It's a little long in size, but reasonable. All connections seem to be snug. It's a very simple device: plug it in, and BYOC (bring your own cables) of any length. For those who want more detail, here it goes:I discovered 3 gotchas when purchasing a USB-based charger like this:1) Get the right version: Almost all devices will charge at up to 500 mA on any charger and in computer USB ports (but slowly). To see if the higher power draw is available, the device looks for a certain signal: In Apple products it is a resistance on the two data wires inside the cable. On Android it is a short on those same wires. In a nutshell: Apple-based devices will not charge at full power on Android-based chargers, and vice versa. This product is made specifically for Galaxy devices for this reason, and your mileage will vary elsewhere.If you want to convert an existing Apple charger to Android, you can either get out your soldering gun or try this device:Smart Adapter Compatible with Samsung Galaxy SI have not used it, but it claims to do that conversion.2) Device capabilities vary: For instance my wife's Galaxy S3 will only charge at up to ~1 amp in any device, no matter how much power I throw at it. If higher-power support is not there in the phone, you're out of luck. Unfortunately these limitations are not documented well, but it's a good bet to estimate using whatever milli-amp rating of the charger that comes with your device.3) Choose the right cable: If you do not have a thick, good quality cable for the length you are using, it will not charge at full speed and/or the power draw will fluctuate. Choose based on the advertised wire gauge number (AWG), with lower numbers being better/thicker.For 1 Amp Charging: 3' 28 AWG, 6' 24 AWG, 10' 22 AWG, 15' 20 AWGFor 2 Amp Charging: 3' 24 AWG, 6' 24 AWG, 10' 20 AWGThese numbers are based on an electrical equation, and I confirmed several of the data points with real-world testing. Note: The quality/design of the cable will introduce some variation, so these lengths/gauges are only an estimate.28 AWG - Standard for most cables when in doubt24 AWG -Monoprice 6ft Gold Plated(confirmed to do at least 1.7 amps)22 AWG - "Link Depot" makes this thicker variant of their normal cable, but it's not available on Amazon and hard to find20 AWG - "Arctic" makes these, but very hard to findPersonally I use a 3.5ft 24 AWG OEM Logitech USB cord that I got with a Harmony remote (not available on Amazon, search eBay for item 220831741556).I do not have a direct way to measure how much power is being drawn by this device, so I will compare with my observations of charging time using a wall charger. A 2 amp wall charger can charge my Note 2 to full in 2 hours while it is idle in standby (50%/hour). To put on maximum power drain, I ran the Stability Test v2.5 app (CPU+GPU stress test), played audio, ran navigation with GPS, and set screen brightness to full. This would normally drain my battery at 30%/hour. On this charger while in my vehicle and under load, my resulting charge was 20%/hour which is perfectly in line with expectations from a 2 amp charging device (50%-30%=+20% net charge). A "normal" load of nav, audio, and medium brightness was a drain of 20%/hour, and it likewise confirmed at net change of +30%/hour.So the charge rate is great: I can run everything to the limit and worst case it still will charge the phone in 5 hours. I'm very pleased with this device. It does what it is spec-ed for and with simplicity.
B004I44CHQ	Works to charge the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and also charge any normal usb devices at the same time.  Good device.
B004I44CHQ	The Scosche reVIVE II car charger kept my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 fully charged while using it as a GPS unit.
B004I44CHQ	I ordered two of these (Scosche reVIVE II - Dual USB Car Charger for Samsung Galaxy Tablet (GUSBC3)) for my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android).Using a NORMAL USB cable, I verified that this is being recognized as an AC adapter (provides FULL charge as-is)!! This is NOT the same as the ones provided for Apple products- those don't provide full charge capability. I could not find another product out there that did same.For it to be recognized as an AC adapter within Android, I did NOT have to:- disassemble and short USB pins- buy a special charging USB cable with the wires shortedTwo thumbs up. In comparison, it seems somewhat large and bulky but if it provides nice, clean, (safe) power, I could live with that.I ordered some really cheap (but decent) USB cables off of monoprice dot com.
B004I44CHQ	I received this today- been testing the charger in my car a couple of times and out of the 2.1 Amp USB socket I don't seem to be getting the full claimed 2.1 Amps- more like less than  1.33 Amps- (I test the charge rate by first plugging my device (Samsung Galaxy Note II) into its supplied AC wall charger that charges at a confirmed 2 amps and in 15 minutes the battery charge goes up by 12%- with the Scosche product in 15 minutes the battery charge  only rises 8%..)- still keeps the phone from losing charge when the GPS screen is on constantly (which is OK)- but only just-keeps the charge rate around the same level (not rising)- wanted a true 2 amp charge rate so I can use my GPS and still gain battery charge at the same time...
B004I44CHQ	I did some research trying to find a car USB charger that would be compatible with my Nexus 7 tablet.  This unit's 2.1 amp port works perfectly.  This is different from the other reVIVE II (the USBC3 rather than this, the GUSBC3) which would work with Apple high-current devices but not anything else.  Make sure you buy the right unit for your devices.  2.1 amp is a higher current than standard USB ports which allows for faster charging (some devices won't charge at all on a lower current).  Since it's not an official USB standard Apple chose to implement high-current charging differently than everyone else, so chargers designed for high-current Apple devices will not work correctly with other high-current devices.  Usually this means that a charger for an iPad will not work for an Android tablet and vice versa.When I connect my Nexus 7 to this charger's 2.1 Amp port the tablet correctly reports it's on a high-current charger (by saying the battery is charging from "AC", which would normally be the wall-outlet adapter [AC power] included with the Nexus 7).
B004I44CHQ	I already have one in my car for mine and my husband's Android phones and my tablet and it works great! I also love how it does the job and doesn't take up so much room like some other car chargers similar to this do. This car charger is so good, I bought another one of these for my mother-in-law to have one in her car for her new Android!
B004I44CHQ	I was skeptical that this thing would be able to provide a charge for my N7 tablet in my car but it works flawlessly with with no mods needed. I have a feeling that it can draw even more than the 2.1A indicated.A major gripe I have with this charger is that it doesn't stay connect to the power adapter very well and ended popping out a few times. In the end, I had to duct tape this charger to it but otherwise it works great. Also the blue light indicator is way too bright.
B004I44CHQ	I had been looking for one that works with my nexus 7. This works perfectly. Also I can charge my epic 4g touch at the same time.
B004K00LH8	Nice, convenient device charger. So nice, I bought a second one for my husband since I liked mine so much.
B004K00LH8	I love this gadget.  I've purchased another one for my husband's truck and a few more as gifts.  I love the retractable cord and the compact size.  It's easily stored away in my glove box or seat console.
B004K00LH8	The product is acceptable as a backup charging device. The device feels a little cheap in its assembly and gets rather warm when in use. The cord retractor stopped working after a couple of months of normal usage but still charges acceptably.
B004K00LH8	this item broke in a week. not worth the hassle to return. I just threw it in the trash and moved on.
B004K00LH8	This Product is excellent. It came quick well packaged and worked right out of the box. Works as described and is quick charging looks good and the pull out cord clicks as it is pulled and is long enough and suffcient for any auto and locks in when extended so no acciedental retractable whipping cord to stress your charging connector on your phone. I would recommend this Product because it is not overpriced and does exactly what it is suppose to do.
B004K00LH8	I bought two of these retractable chargers (my car and purse).  I Love it.  Would recommend to everyone. Does not take up too much room. Just perfect.
B004K00LH8	I have an LG Revolution which is what this charger is made for, but it doesn't work. It did work the first 2-3 times I used it, then it suddenly stopped working. I plug the phone in and it doesn't register that it's charging. I thought maybe it was charging, but just didn't show the battery building while plugged in, but my battery continued to drain even without using the phone as if it were not plugged in.
B004K00LH8	I loved this product!  The retractable cord is perfect for use in my vehicle. It charges effortlessly. May order another one.
B004K00LH8	I ordered a car charger for my lgrevolution phone late friday and received it thursday so cudos on timelyness. i like the price, the quality of the item is good. i haven't used it get but over all a pleasant experence.
B004K00LH8	I love the cord on this because its not hanging all over the car. When I am done I can push the button and bam! Gone!  :)
B004K00LH8	It works, looks good, retracts maybe too fast, dirt cheap and the blue light adds some cool to your interior. Now it just has to last!
B004K00LH8	This device feels cheap and gets really warm when charging.  It also takes a very long time to charge your phone.  Im not impressed by it.
B004K00LH8	I love the retractable car charger! It takes up very little space and no cords are laying around the car! Fast shipping
B004K00LH8	This is the first time I purchased an accessory for my cell phone that wasn't being sold by the manufacturer or service provider.  I am a little concerned that it heats up when I use it.  Way more than the &#34;official&#34; one I use to have and lost.But, it does the job and I do hope it doesn't do damage to the phone as all manufacturers threaten will happen if we don't buy their accessories.
B004K00LH8	I like them. They work great!!  They also take up less room than the other chargers. I would recommend these!
B004K00LH8	Excelente Producto, excelente calidad, tiene una luz que indica que funciona,la manera retractil funciona super bien, estoy super satisfecha de mi compra,es mas voy a comprar otro para tenerlo de repuesto, pues por la calidad y el preciovale muchisimo la pena!!! Recomiendo este producto les va a encantar!!!
