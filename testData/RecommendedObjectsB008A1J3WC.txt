B003WRH2PO	There are definitely better car holders on the market, but with the entire set of accessories, I love it.  I now can have chargers in both vehicles and an extra travel charger in my purse for emergencies.
B003WRH2PO	The product is versatile, in that one can use it with a number of devices, since it has superior flexibility and re-sizing options that most other holders not have.  While the suction function could be a little stronger, the device is invaluable both from a usability and safety perepective.  Add together the other items in the package, and the one is getting a great deal.  I regularly use the chargers for my Sansung Galaxy S Vibrant, and use the case as a storage backup for travel.I have to mention, that I am very immpressed with the courtesy and professionalism of the customer service - I accidentally snapped off a piece of the mounting, and they were happy to send me a replacement, immediately, so my entire device wouldnt be rendered useless. While I have yet to determine if this is a weak spot or my own fault (the breakage), I appreciate the help.  Such customer service is rare, and for this reason alone, I would recommend this and other purchases from this company.
B003WRH2PO	I've bought two of these now.  Not only did both of the suction cups stop working after one application, the mounts also fell apart and could not be reassembled.  A classic example of the worst of the terrible design and quality control coming out of China.At least it's cheap.
B004BDGT6Q	I got what I paid for. The second I put the case onto my phone I began to see tiny cracks all around the corners of the case. The next day one of the corners came off. One by one, the corners of the case fell apart. The case lasted less than 24 hours.
B004ZLVOVY	I was disappointed with this product.  It is cheap and it broke the first time I used it.  Money down the tubes.
B005GSRJQ4	I bought this cable for my blackberry, but it doesn't do anything.  It doesn't charge to transfer data and didn't come with any printed info.  So for under $4.00 I'll just toss it because it's not worth spending money to return it.
B005GSRJQ4	This cable does not work for the Blackberry Curve as stated in the title. It does not fit properly into the slot on the Blackberry and my computer failed to recognize it. Waste of money.
B005QB63SQ	I really enjoy the battery life time, it really lasts. So far its lasting me all day with heavy use of Pandora, Netflix, and applications. It came protected and also came with a small pamphlet giving instructions on how to have better battery life. A friend of mine has the same phone and i've told him about how great this battery is, because his battery doesn't last him more than half of the day.I would rate 5 starts, but im having problems with the back cover. It recently begins to come apart when texting or having it in my pocket. I just got the Samsung Stratosphere on Tuesday and got this battery in the mail on Wednesday, and just yesterday its being getting annoying because it would not close properly on the lower left corner of the cover. And then it would snap off on all of the left side, I have tried putting tape on the inside to make it stick to the phone but it just wont work.I've contacted the seller in hope of getting a back cover that stays on the phone. That way I can order one for my friend and hope his back cover doesn't end up like mine.UPDATE:I got a new battery cover sent to me, and this one fits way better than the one I received with the battery :) now I can use my phone with this wonderful battery. I finished conditioning the battery and now it lasts all day, with use of pandora, youtube and facebook. And somehow after im done using my 4g or wifi the battery goes up, like il be on on 6% and then it'll go up to 10%
B005QB63SQ	The cover and the extended battery fit perfectly, making the phone thicker, but much longer battery life makes it well worth it; still fits easily in my shirt pocket. No sign of cover cracks or problems. Excellent!!!
B005QB63SQ	I bought this for my fiancee's phone because he goes through his battery so quickly.  He can easily get over a day out of this battery and he likes how it makes for phone thicker for his bigger hands.  Definitely well worth the money!!
B005QB63SQ	I thought this might be the all day answer to my battery needs. It certainly is big enough to warrant thinking that it could last until a nighttime charge. But no - I followed the initial charging instruction to the letter. I think on average it may have added about 15 - 20% battery life to my phone. Given the ridonkulous size of the battery and included cover, I use it as a back-up now. It was simply too uncomfortable in my pocked with the added depth and without better performance it just didn't seem worth it. It really does add about three times the initial size to the phone. If it had powered like it looked...it would have been great. But alas...no.
B005QB63SQ	The battery does not last as long as all the reviews said and the battery stopped working after a month
B005QB63SQ	This is my daughters phone.  She is 13 and is a responsible kid.  The battery does fit but if you touch the phone a certain way or set it down on the table or put it in your pocket, the battery pops off.  I would buy it even if it were my phone.
B005QB63SQ	I chose this rating brcause Iam extremely happy with the 4000mAh battery:) I love the time I spend with my phone. I recommend this battery to tho9se who hate hooking up the phone to charge 2-3 times a day
B005QB63SQ	Great case. I have been using this case over 6 months now and it still looks new even with daily use in and out of my pocket. No problems at all.
B005QB63SQ	The battery is very poor and does not store a charge well. Very disssapointed in this product. I have tried new and differnent chargers.
B005QB63SQ	We were disappointed that the battery did not last any longer than the phone's original battery.  Shipping, cost, and return were all satisfactory, but we still have a phone that can't make it through the day on a full charge...
B005QB63SQ	I didn't expect much when I purchased this battery. I just thought I would give it a try and maybe get a little bit extra time on my battery life. I was pleasently surprised by what I got. First off, your phone is no longer going to look sleek and slim with this battery on it (you don't get something for nothing). The phone becomes significantly more bulky but it is easily installed and the new case is quick to switch out. I have been using the battery for a few weeks now and have yet to have a day when my battery died on me. I use my phone for listening to podcasts, playing music in my classroom, watching Netflix and letting my son watch movies. Even on days where I am on it most of the day, my phone is never below 25% by the end of the day. The only con I have is: bulkiness (good luck finding a protective case after you install this bad boy) but this is to be expected when you buy any extended battery.
B005QB63SQ	Not sure if it is 4000mAh but it does extend the battery...I can now make it through the work day without charging the phone twice...So I like it!
B005QB63SQ	I use this battery as an emergency battery just in case. You wouldnt need to charge your phone for days if you don't do anything with your phone besides a few calls a day and checking the time. Recommended buy.
B005QB63SQ	The battery arrived a day early (way to go Amazon).I followed the instructions that came with the battery, to drain it before recharging.  I then recharged it overnight and it showed a full charge in the morning, with very light use (weekend day and I was home) the battery was discharged by early evening.  I recharged it again overnight, Sunday morning the charge only lasted about 2 hours.  Recharged it last night again and this morning the battery is only showing between a third and a quarter charge.I'll be returning this battery.I had high hopes for this battery when I got it.  It's much bigger than the stock battery AND it's even bigger than the extended battery sold by Samsung.  This is a blessing and a curse.  I bought the Samsung extended battery when I bought the phone, they were out of the protective cases at the Verizon store where I bought the phone so I bought one at a store close by.  Fits great with the Samsung extended battery, but because the Trexcell is larger than the Samsung battery you have to use the Trexcell supplied back cover - which is a smidgen higher than the Samsung unit and does not allow for the ruggedized protector to be installed over it.  I would have given up the back cover extra protection for the expected battery life, but not for the performance of this battery.Wish it would have worked better.
B005QB63SQ	I was so disgusted with the battery life of my new Stratosphere that I was about to give up and try a different phone, in spite of the fact I really like the phone.  Eight hours, however, was far too short.  Someone suggested an extended life battery and I got this one a few  weeks ago.  It has made an amazing difference.  Even with the power hogs--wifi, bluetooth, etc.--on it lasts me a good 24 hours.I must admit I don't game, listen to music, watch video on my phone.  But I do spend considerable time on the web and use several other aps fairly heavily. The slightly thicker back isn't enough to make a difference when in the cell phone pocket of my purse.This is a bargain price solution.
B005QB63SQ	This phone is notorious for fast draining batteries. Bought this on recommendation from a friend.  Very good product!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
B005QB63SQ	Fast delivery great quality and condition of product no complaints here!I like how the phone feels with the extended battery I have big hands so its easy to hold
B005QB63SQ	I got it ahead of schedule and now I get a full day of service instead of having to charge it twice a day.  So far so good.
B005QB63SQ	I bought this because my regular battery had begun to only last about 3 hours off of an overnight charge. I really really wanted to love this extended battery but I just don't. First, you can not have cases over your phone (I knew before I ordered this) so you have to be very careful with your phone. Second, once you get the case on it is extremely difficult to get back off, HOWEVER if you drop your phone theres a 99% chance that the back and battery will fly off. Now I bought a new Verizon charger that's supposed to rapid charge, so that helps with not having to have my phone on the charger ALL the time, but it still takes a couple hours to go from a dying phone to full charge, even at 50% battery it takes a couple hours. I wont be buying another since my upgrade is coming up soon. But it you are where I was at where you cant leave the house without a charger at all this is a good cheap alternative, but don't expect a miracle.
B005QB63SQ	If you're a hipster in skinny jeans, this probably isn't for you. Since I'm no hipster, and nothing about my body type would bring the word "skinny" to mind, I have no complaints about this battery/cover combination. It's charged well each time I've used it. The only inconvenience is fitting the thicker phone into your pocket.
B005QB63SQ	After charging the battery fully and changing the case it worked great. Not a fault of yours, but was disappointed that no one makes a holster for it and it would not fit my holster. Otherwise it works as intended.
B005QB63SQ	This battery barely worked. I ended up not using it because it would hold a charge. Not happy at all.
B005QB63SQ	This keeps a charge longer than the original.  It does need to be charged daily to keep charged but doesnt run down as fast or as often.  Slightly larger battery so thicker but not a reason not to go with a battery that has a longer charge
B005QB63SQ	The battery did not last as long as the slim one did.  The reseller was amazon so returns were easy but there a hassle
B005QB63SQ	I completely discharged and charged the battery several times as the manufacture recommends, and it is still no better or no worse than the original battery from Samsung.  If you are looking for an extra battery and a thicker phone this is for you, but if you are hoping for an extended battery as stated than this product is not for you.
B005QB63SQ	As promised, this really extended the life of my phone...however, it made the phone too thick for my liking (this battery is 3x thicker than the original) I would not have bought it had I known that. In addition, I cannot find a protective case to go over it because of the thickness!
B005QB63SQ	I read plenty of reviews for this batter before I purchased it, and I've determined why they were so unhappy. It's simply that they lived longer than one week after installing this battery. You see, for the first week in operation the battery works fantastically. It easily tripled the time I could go between charges. And then a week later it lasted exactly as long as a normal battery. Only now my phone was twice as thick, which is exactly the type of increase that everyone's looking for in phones these days, right?So, if you only really require a phone for the next week, and your pants have pockets designed to fit a small child, then this is just the battery for you!
B005QB63SQ	The battery does not last as long as the original battery.  I charged the battery on the phone before I used the phone and I get less use of the phone than I did.  The battery weighs MORE than the phone and provides less battery life.
B005QB63SQ	Keeps a decent charge, can't really tell if it's any longer than with the normal battery. But it works well enough.
B005QB63SQ	When using this product you no longer have a nice slim phone, however, the extended battery life is well worth the larger size.  The only thing is that it is hard to get a case that the phone fits in.
B005QB63SQ	I loved this battery and case when I first got it. I conditioned it as detailed by the seller and the battery life is so much better than the standard. Definitely double the capacity.After several months, the battery swelled and would no longer fit under the cover. I peeled the wrapping off the battery to try to get it to fit but still had to tape the cover on to make it work. A swelling battery is usually a quality issue.I'll try a different brand next time.So five stars for battery life and price and 1 star for quality and longevity.
B005QB63SQ	The battery doesn't fit as tightly in the phone as the factory battery, so a hard jolt and the battery will move enough to kill the connection and turn off the phone.  I now have to slowly slide the keyboard closed (as opposed to letting it fly) because the jolt will turn off the phone.I do not recommend this product.  Sure, the battery lasts longer, but that's obvious granted the size difference.
B005QB63SQ	The battery and cover fits great - it even gives the phone a little more &#34;heft&#34; which makes it feel more sturdy than before.However, I really only see a &#34;very slight&#34; increase in the run time on my phone. This is disappointing because I am a very light user of the phone - very few apps - and absolutely no gaming and was looking to only charge every other day or so.Even with my  slight use, I still have to charge the phone up at least twice a day, which is about the same as I had to with the battery that came with the phone.With this said, I still like the battery and cover for the way that it feels in my hand.
B005QB63SQ	The extended battery lasts all day and into the next day with regular use.  If you listen to music, it does use it up faster but still not as fast as the normal battery.  The only downside to having an extended battery is the lack of any cell phone covers that you can buy that will fit.  So I use a cover on the front only because the back is too big to fit a normal cover.  It also makes the phone heavier, but I don't mind since my battery doesn't run out in the middle of the day.
B005QB63SQ	I can finally use my phone and still have a charge at the end of the day.The cover makes it thicker but it's easier to hold.
B005QB63SQ	In all respect,  you should throw this product in the toilet,  but then it might clog it up, just to be crappy.
B005QB63SQ	This battery is a great upgrade for dealing with the abomindably short battery life the OEM battery--I can now run the phone all day without being tethered to a charging cord.  The extra size and weight are well worth it.  The problem is that after a couple months the back cover started spontaneously unsnapping from the back of the phone, to the point where I had to use clear packing tape to hold the case together, which is not an easy thing to do with a slide-out phone.  Even with the tape the cover still randomly disconnected and left a 1/8" gap, which kept getting wider by the week and will, I suspect, eventually widen to the point where the battery will disconnect and shut off the phone.  Initially I thought the problem was the cover, but after some looking I discovered that the battery itself was swelling and was pushing on the cover and causing it to pop off.  I'm not sure what's causing the battery to swell.  The battery has swelled to the point where the cover no longer stays on at all so I have to either replace the battery or the phone.  I think I'm going to opt for replacing the phone so I don't have to deal with this issue at all.  So my advice is:  don't get this phone (Samsung Stratosphere) to begin with, but if you already have one, get this battery to make the phone usable and be prepared to buy another battery (buying one per year isn't so bad given the low cost of the battery) if the battery swells up on you and makes the back pop off.
B005QB63SQ	I have received the Trexcell Samsung Stratosphere 4G 40000mah Extended Battery and it was dead on arrival. I followed the instruction for charging it with no success, completely dead. The bad thing is that you can not get another one as a replacement so you loose your shipping fee twice if you want to get another one.
B005QB63SQ	Well, it's a good battery.  4000 mAh might be a bit of a generous rating, but it does seem to last about twice as long between charges as the OEM Samsung battery.  The deeper back cover makes the phone about 1.5x thicker than OEM, which I happen to like.  My phone feels more like a phone and less like a nacho now*.  However, this augmented profile unfortunately excludes the Stratosphere from using any nifty aftermarket snap-on covers.  You'll either need some sort of pouch / holster, or at least a Zagg Invisible Shield (which I'd recommend even with the OEM battery and a snap-on case anyway) to protect the screen.In any case, the new battery plus back cover turned my phone into something easier to hold and manipulate the slide-out keyboard without turning my phone into a Zack Morris Saved By The Bell 1980's cell phone.  My phone's power lasts from the time I leave for work till the time I go to bed, despite being subjected to many rounds of Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja throughout the day.  The back cover is stylish and resistant to scratches when my phone shares a pocket with my keys.  All in all, this is a worthwhile upgrade for your Stratosphere.* Really.  Why do phone manufacturers insist that thinner is better?  Do these guys think consumers want to use their phones to slice vegetables or something?  I hate it when I'm trying to answer a call and end up with a paper cut from my phone.
B005QB63SQ	The battery is fine as far as holding charge.  Last a whole dayOnly problem with this battery is that it is slightly smaller.. may be a millimeter or two...what that does is.. when you are walking with phone in pocket or move the phone quickly in hand, sometimes it disconnects from the phone's sensor...which leads to the phone turning off... and you have to manually turn the phone on again.Battery holds power just wish they had made it right length so it does not disconnect.. The disconnection happens 2-3 times day for me :(
B005QB63SQ	I bought this because it would extend the battery life of my stratosphere phone alot..but I can't really see much difference than the one that came with it.  If i use it I still have to charge every day.
B005QB63SQ	I was really upset with my decision to buy a Samsung Stratosphere... until i bought the extended battery. Now I get a day and a half on one charge. Really enjoying ther phone now thanks entirely to this purchase.
B005QB63SQ	WHILE I AM NOT A SMART PHONE EXPERT, ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS BATTERY FIT WELL AND SEEMS TO LAST QUIET A BIT LONGER THAN THE BALLERY SUPPLIED BY SAMSUNG. NO REGRETS HERE.
B005QB63SQ	Extends play time like crazy - but the battery pack is much thicker than the origial - can't have everything/ Great item, thanks
B005QB63SQ	The battery is fine but after a while it won't keep its charge and then the backcover kept falling off and cracked in 2 different places.
B005QB63SQ	I pulled my phone off the charger, listened to an entire game on NFL Mobile (with my 4G connection on), then played some music for another few hours. The battery was still at 40% capacity by the time I plugged it back in, more than 16 hours later.As expected, such a high-capacity battery adds thickness to the phone, but I found the added thickness to be more of a help than a hindrance. The phone feels better in my hands now, and won't slip out if I try to slide my keyboard out with just one hand.As with any typical user, I drop my phone from time to time. Luckily, the battery cover that comes with this battery is strong, and tough to break. I slid a piece of double-sided Scotch tape between the phone and the battery to keep its weight from popping the cover off in the event of a drop. Even before I did this, dropping the phone and having the battery pop out did not result in breaking the battery cover, which was a huge problem with the extended batteries in my old phones (F*** the Blackberry Storm/Storm II).Trexcell even includes a small leaflet with the package that explains EXACTLY how to condition and charge your battery, addressing the topics of full-discharge, partial charging, and frequency of charging. I followed their instructions carefully, and can confidently say that my phone will last 2-3 days with moderate use if I need it to.For less than $20 with Amazon Prime's free 2-day shipping, there's no reason not to get this battery for your phone. Even if you get it and decide you don't like the thickness it adds, you'll still be able to keep it and use it as a backup battery for those days when you forget to charge your OEM slim battery (which will probably happen often if you stick with it).
B005QB63SQ	After about 4 months the tabs inside the battery cover broke.  First one then another one.  The battery works GREAT.  I love the extra juice but the cover keeps coming off.  I would like a replacement or improvement but it seems that the only way to get a cover is to buy the set (battery plus cover).  Now my cover will not stay on, this is a real pain. I looked at buying other cases but since this is 4000mAH the other extended battery covers work on 3500mAH so I am stuck wondering my next step
B006GT5LM6	Excellent product. Excellent Price. Quality item.  Shipped fast.  Excellent communication. Fit the phone very well.  Would purchase another if needed.
B006GT5LM6	Dont waste 5 dollars on this. Case is too small for the phone. Buy a different case. It looks nice though.
B006GT5LM6	Case is 1 inch shorter than the phone. I special ordered this case expecting it to fit because I need it right away. How I have to find something else. Beware of this product.
B006WSEYVK	Product did not fit my phone as advertised.  I was able to trim product down to fit my phone and it works very well.
B006WSEYVK	It says it fits the Huawei Glory, but it doesn't.  It's way too long and slightly too wide.  It's a good quality protector, but worthless if it doesn't fit the phone it says it fits.  I tried to put it down, but it's hard to get the corners right, so this was a waste of money.
B006WSEYVK	Did not fit the Huawei Glory phone.  They were too long and did not adhere to surface.  Very very disappointed.
B006WSEYVK	I had to trim the top and side to get it to fit right, if you don't mind trimming the shield it is ok.
B006WSEYVK	Not what it says it was. Did not fit the phone properly. Wouldn't recommend at all. Not correct at all
B006WSEYVK	These state they fit a Huawei Glory M886, My phone has the same name only the number is 868. These are slightly too long bottom to top and have to be trimmed to fit.
B006WSEYVK	These cover are the best I have used With most other covers I have a hard time getting rid of the bubbles under the coverNancy Hughes
B006WSEYVK	Y Have A New Huawei Inspira Phone H 867G Net 10 So looking for screen protection for my phone. So decide to purchase Empire Huawei Glory Screen Protection. Rated 4 Stars because the price very nice. Plus shipping very fast. The screen very long, to long for my type of phone. Decide to trime a little of the bottom so my phone can fit im the New Case. What I do that for ? After that had a trouble all 4 corner poping up only protection I had was the center of the phone. So was not happy about that. It protect my phone don't have scatches at all. As of 1-13-14 Now have the screen protection need for my phone. Thanks ! Ms. McRae
B006WSEYVK	I guess I will learn one of these days that no screen protector EVER works without the accompanying bubbles.  This was just one mor time.  Waste of money, tore it off and tossed it in the trash.
B006WSEYVK	The protector was too large for the phone - although it was listed by Amazon as the correct 'skin'..... tried to trim it to fit... went on skewed, but it will still protect the surface
