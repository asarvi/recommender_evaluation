B000165BXO	I was using this product with a Motorola E815 ... the first time I tried to use it was on a very busy street, during the rain. The receiving audio seemed full of static, and both the receiving and transmitting audio seemed to fade in and out. I just chalked it up to the adverse environment.The second time I tried it in the comfort of my home; the receiving side fading and static were still quite apparent. I had to return this headset, which was unfortunate - it is very comfortable for someone who wears glasses.
B000165BXO	Although this earpiece is comfortable, it is difficult to make myself heard.Further, mobile devices use this tiny connector. It should be made in the 3.5mm connector.
B000165BXO	Fits nicely onto my ear, but I still sound distant over the connection. I'm still using it tho because I haven't found anything to do it better, certainly not the Panasonic KX-TCA93.
B000165BXO	Bluetooth get lost, this is the best headset. Just put it in your ear and go, doesn't get tiring and doesn't lose battery.
B000165BXO	Pros: Light and comfortable, very good microphone clarity, good earpiece sound.Con: Somewhat difficult to wear; no earpiece volume amplification and microphone mute button.I purchased a Plantronics MX153-M1 (for $22 at an family-run electronics store a few blocks away from J&R; Music and Computer World), the version of the MX150 made specifically for Motorola phones - v60, v70, v120, T720 and later phones. The MX153-M1 adds a push-button towards the upper-middle of its cord that enables the headset wearer to dial the last-dialed number, use voice-activated dialing, answer calls, and end calls without touching the phone. The MX153-N1 and MX153-N3 are push-button versions of the MX150 for Nokia phones. The base MX150 itself does not have the push-button and associated functionality.The MX150's earbud is anchored to the wearer's ear by a soft rubber grip that wraps under and essentially clips the earlobe (pinna). It takes several seconds to fit the earbud and pivot the microphone boom to their proper angles; this must be done each time the wearer puts on the headset. The disadvantage of this fitting requirement is that if you are not already wearing the headset when your phone starts ringing, you are better off answering your phone the old-fashion way. Once fitted however, the MX150 is light and comfortable to point of being unnoticeable. The MX150's FlexGrip design (shared by the Plantronics MX100 family) is better than ear-loop designs that can get in the way of eyeglasses and sunglasses; headband designs that can pull on the wearer's hair; and classic earbud designs that can easily fall off. People with earrings may not be comfortable with the MX150 because of its grip on the ear's pinna.In contrast to generic headset microphones that often make the wearer sound distant, the MX150's microphone performance is very good and makes the wearer sound clear and close to the phone. The noice-cancelling microphone does a good job of eliminating ambient noise - even inside a moving New York City subway car. The MX150 family does not have microphone volume control and microphone mute functions.Earpiece performance is good. The MX150 lacks earpiece volume control, relying instead on the phone's volume control functions. As with any headset design lacking self-powered earpiece volume amplification, ambient noise may be an issue in open or noisy environments, e.g. a busy New York City street or subway car.The MX150's price competition is with the Jabra ProBoom. The latter has battery-powered earpiece volume amplification, but consumers should carefully weigh this great advantage against the MX150's fit and weight benefits. The two competitors also differ in push-button support. The MX150 family has push-button models for Motorola and Nokia phones, while the ProBoom family has push-button models for Nokia and Samsung phones.Of the three Plantronics headsets that I have purchased (the other two being the M175 and M100), the MX153-M1 is the best one that I have yet used.
B000165BXO	For those who don't like bluetooth this is the next best thing.  My husband uses it in the semi and loves it.
B002IFZNPM	I bought these so I could answer my phone while walking.  They work fairly good with phone calls, you have to speak loud so you can be heard.  My one fault is they do not fit thight in my ears.OEM Motorola EH25 Blue Fashion Stereo Headset - 3.5mm
B002IFZNPM	Very pleased with my motorola headset, clarity is clean.  Shopped around locally for this item, either unavailable or too pricey from my local verizon dealer.  Packaging is simple, no blister pack, paid for item and not packaging.  Received item sooner than expected which was a surprise to me being from Hawaii!. Keep up the good work!.
B002IFZNPM	Recipient reports great sound/comfortable fit. What else is there? I own an older model of this line and they were also great. Good product line.
B002IFZNPM	After going through a few of the cheap generic iphone buds, these are like heaven. Especially for the price, they're well made and sound great, seriously good bass. I'm really happy with this purchase.
B002IFZNPM	Awesome product..this is like my 20th pair...I wear them out at work....since amazon has such a good deal on them ...I buy 3 at a time....
B002IFZNPM	I purchased a total of three headsets.  The first pair, my husband lost.  So, I recently purchased two additional pair.  The quality is very good, clear and crisp.  The headset is aesthetically appealing as well, it coordinates with my cell and the protective case.  Reasonably priced...the only con would be it took so long to receive product.
B002IFZNPM	These are my workhorse earphones. I get them over and over because they work very well for their purposes. The mic works well on calls, the ability to advance tracks or answer phones via the headset is great. The size and padding works well in the ear. No complaints. I have looked around a lot and these do a great job. I am not an audiophile so I can't say whether they are the best for listening to music but they do OK for me. I am a business user and love these things.
B002IFZNPM	I dig these and the price is right. I've owned six pairs and I just bought ten more to keep my stock up. They are just as sturdy as any other headphone but I use mine constantly and the process of taking them in out of my jean or jacket pockets all day long takes a toll. First the foam pads get ripped off. Then the ring of rubber. Then the metal screen. Then the speakers themselves get ripped out. Along they way you'll probably over stretch the cord where it attaches to the mic and you'll need to fix it with electrical tape.Each pair lasts me about four months before they are destroyed. So now I have three years worth in reserve. At about seven bucks a pair that comes to about twenty-one dollars per year to enable me to listen to music, watch movies, and take calls all at the same time with a single device. That's a bargain.
B002IFZNPM	These work just fine for music or phone on a phone or mp3 or Disc if ya still have and use one!
B002IFZNPM	What I do with headphones, is that I buy a bunch of cheap ones and hope they last me for awhile. After 2 months, I'm still on my first pair, and I am absolutely happy with my purchase. They are good quality, they are comfy in the ear, and they work! Need a quick pair of headphones? Get these.
B002IFZNPM	2 of these didn't work at all and felt silly to return.  They wanted me to repackage and send when they cost nothing.  Will never order again.  What a waste of time and money.
B002IFZNPM	I was looking for a nice wired headset for my Atrix. This headset worked fine with Atrix and also Motorola Defy, voice clarity was good for voice calls and for gtalk calls as well. Supports answer/end button.
B002IFZNPM	It was hard to find a headset that fits good in your ears, while walking and etc. I knew I wanted ones that fit like ipod ones. Well these do! They dont fall out when Im moving my head a lot, walking really fast or anything. the color is really nice too. I can hear perfectly clear, and people can hear me thro the mic. It works great for my motorola bionic. for under 10 bucks you cant go wrong!
B002IFZNPM	My son is very picky about his headphones. He loves these. However, he has a bad habit of chewing on the cord, so I have returned to purchase these over and over again. I use a pair as well and feel it is a high quality headset with good sound. Will keep returning to purchase these as long as they are available.
B002IFZNPM	I ordered these after i found out that my motorola backflip does not come with headphones. wtf?! i know right. anyways i hit google and found out that motorola sold these as separate accessories (the tmobile cliq has them included) i so i searched amazon and came across these, knowing they were originals from factory they probably had an okay sound type, and over all performance. Wrong. they have awesome sound, bass is deep and reach (beyonce video phone playing lol) microphone is awesome and located in the right position. people said i sounded clear and with no background noise. shipping was super fast ordered the 11th of june got them the 14 of june, and that because the weekend got in the way of shipping. i highly recommend for anybody looking for headphones with a mic, i gonna order more for my wife and 2 kids we all have the same phones. And they come with an adapter for the 2.5mm phones. im so pleased with these.
B002IFZNPM	We all know these are cheap headsets due the price alone. We hope for the best and sometimes you can get lucky. However there is no lucky streak with these headsets.They simply are horrible. Dont waste your time nor resources its takes to get them to your house or business. Pass
B0031QAZCI	The Motorola S205 Stereo ear buds work well enough... they were the least expensive units of their type on Amazon so I thought to try them.The fact is they're cheap. The design's poor (the buds don't fit into small ear canals) the wiring is very small (susceptible to damage easily) and they aren't the classiest looking sound devices.They are however: inexpensive (with quick delivery from Justpal), light weight, easy to store in pockets, have great bass response, and work fairly well with all the systems I've tried them on (Droid, PC, IPod....). I originally purchased the buds to see if they would fit my lifestyle--and they do. So, if an inexpensive test is what you're after these will work. But, for extended use they're not very comfortable. I'll be looking for a pair of more comfortable buds in the future.
B0031QAZCI	These are the best earbuds I've ever heard. They're very bassy but also treble and mids come through great. They're great for music and talking. The microphone isn't the best but isn't the worst either. Sometimes I have to hold it to my mouth, which is pretty typical for these kinds of buds, but the mic is a little farther down than most.My only real complaint is that the button only works to pause/play and answer a phone call. I can't hold down the button and activate voice dial, and I can't hang up a phone call with it. They're a keeper, but I'm sure there's better buds out there.
B0031QAZCI	These sound good.  The ear cushion fall off very easy.  They were off in less than a week.  I will probably not order these again.
B0031QAZCI	The ear buds are a little big, but I felt the sounds was very good and they require a lot less volume from whatever device you are using to be very loud. The button works, but the clicking isn't very satisfying or crisp. If you really want the good stuff, you have to get one that goes into the ear canal, but I can't stand those. These are one of the best ones of the non-canal ones that I have found.
B0031QAZCI	This little beauty will provide perfectly clear and convenient hands-free calls.  It's made well and will last a long time.My investment in this product was $8 and I've used it for almost 2 years.
B0031QAZCI	The headset works fine, problem is that I order wrong size for my NET10-W408g Motorola cell phone.No complaints just my Mistake.
B0031QAZCI	The product was as described. The headset was used with my Droid 3 phone. It has pretty good quality and definitely does the job for me. May not be for you if you are looking for high quality headphones.
B0031QAZCI	Nothing special about the product. It has cheap build quality, doesn't stay inside your ears and falls off while you are out for a run..  You get what you pay for.This product is cheap for a reason..
B0031QAZCI	The sound was not clear. The button did not work properly. The cable broke while I was riding my back. Very thin cable and low sound
B0031QAZCI	Motorola's website lists several handsfree headsets with mini-USB jacks as being compatible with the Motorola Atrix. They aren't. I bought this model and it works great for calls. Volume and sound on my end of the conversation are above average, and I've had no complaints so far from anyone I've spoken to.
B0031QAZCI	I bought three of these so I could have one everywhere. I have been frustrated with Bluetooth with disconnecting and having to recharge them all the time. These were very inexpensive so I have one at my office desk, home and 2 in the car. The sound quality isn't the best so if you listen to a lot of music you might chose something else. I use them mostly for talking on the phone and they work pretty good.
B0031QAZCI	Apart from the big ear phones, it seems to be a normal headset. The voice clarity is good. But I can't seem to get these to fit in my ears easily and so will be looking for a replacement soon!
B0031QAZCI	I was completely frustrated with my phone and various bluetooth products. This works perfectly for me. I can listen to my music and never miss a call. Sound is great. I am ready to order a backup.
B0031QAZCI	Had this product for less than a year and it fell apart!  Also, the ear buds do not stay well in the ear.
B0031QAZCI	this is a cheap, ugly, but very nice headset. Yes it is ugly, but works well with my Atrix. A good backup for my bluetooth headset.
B0031QAZCI	The headset is very useful and works well with my Atrix.Features:+ Good performance when ambient noise is low. Can talk and hear normally.+ I can use the one button to activate voice command apps (whichever app you set up) so that I can make calls, send msg, play music, plus a lot of stuff just with voice commands. Set up is easy too.+ Once click redial from button. This can be done even without activating voice commands.+ Music quality is decent.- I have not been able to control the playlists through the device. So, cannot skip, replay songs etc.- When surrounding noise is high , like when in traffic, it is harder to talk and listen. (It is obvious as it does not have any noise cancelling)
B0031QAZCI	works fine. Nothing special. Does , what it is supposed to do. Have been using it for more than a year now, so nothing to complain. Still intact and working.
B00329UMHM	These head phones are perfect. Sound quality is superb. the look is as stylish as i am. it's the best head set for any teen or young adult, and very durable. Thanks amazon for wonderful service.
B00329UMHM	Bad purchase never arrived at its destination marketers never bothered to reply or send me the tracking number refunded my money but that does not have the bad times that made me go I will not buy anything from these vendors
B00329UMHM	great for phone use and the mic is very sensitive, not for regular headphone use though. The earbuds slip out a lot and they sound hollow so sound quality is low. Also mine broke after a couple of months, but I liked them enough to buy the same brand, they were cheap anyway.great for blackberry storm
B00329UMHM	Very fast service & awesome headphones. I love them. I'm very happy with my purchase. The price is very reasonable and the quality is great too.
B00329UMHM	Cute, but annoying. when the cord splits into two wires, one is long and the other is short, and so one keeps getting pulled out of my ear. They don't stay in my ear very well, and they feel weird in there. But MOST IMPORTANTLY the sound doesn't work right in one earbud. The volume seems normal on one side, but super quiet on the other. This happened after very few uses. I bought a new set now and I'm not looking back.
B00329UMHM	I bought this Item so that my grandchildren won't keep borrowing mine. And now they fight each other for this pair of headset.
B00329UMHM	Great product.  When I only have the earphones in my ear and not on, I literally cannot hear any outside noise at all.  GREAT PRODUCT, but no matter what I do, the ear buds keep popping out.  They will never stay in. I can't even have a conversation sitting or laying down and NOT moving.  I bought them hopping the rubber buds would keep them from falling out of my ear when I would run on the treadmill, but it won't even stay in while sitting.
B00352LWBQ	I thought this thinking it would work for my Samsung Rugby Smart, seeing how it is another Samsung product and all. The offset earphones fall out of your ears because the weight is not balanced. my phone doesn't work unless you actually press in the button
B00352LWBQ	you can buy the Samsung Stereo Headset for Samsung SGH-A797/SGH-A687  its a very good product, the quality and the price its very good
B00352LWBQ	I purchased this for use with a Samsung A687 hoping for better sound than I was getting with a fairly expensive bluetooth device.  I'm very pleased.  Telephone conversations are crystal clear, the volume is good, and the other parties indicate that they hear me as clearly as if it were a landline (no distracting ambient noise like the other device was apparently picking up).The cord is approximately 40 inches long from the plug to the mic (where the line splits off to each ear bud).  It reaches below your knees if you're wearing the headset, so plenty long enough for normal use.Although I don't use the phone to listen to music, I did try it with this product and the sound was acceptable -- way better than I expected given the price.
B00352LWBQ	They're good if you're deaf not because they're particularly loud. It's just that deaf people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the atrocious sound quality of these headphones and that of others, even ones that are similarly priced! Do yourself a favor, spend a few extra bucks and get another set.
B00352LWBQ	I received these headsets around 11/17/2011 and they have already started to shorten out. The sound quality is very flat. They feel, look, and sound very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product!  :-(
B00352LWBQ	The sound quality is better and the adaptor cord points down when attached to the phone. The previous set I owned pointed upward, which may have contributed to its demise.
B00352LWBQ	These headphones do last a while (provided that you don't get the wire caught on anything).  They could have been a little bit louder, and when they do start to fade, it sucks.... Great price though.
B00352LWBQ	It's good to use. I can walk around and free my hand when I'm calling. good.
B00352LWBQ	This headset for Samsung SGH-A797 or SGH-A687 works great.  It is easy to use and produces crystal clear communication through the speaker and earbuds.  I have to recommend!
B00352LWBQ	love this earpiece i work outside alot and it is nice to be able to answer the phone with dirt on my hands sound quality is good. will recommend
B00352LWBQ	I needed a headset when driving around and I've noticed that I have been getting headaches whenever I put my phone to my head. Headset takes care of that issue.
B00352LWBQ	I guess it's a good product, but the cords to the earpiece are too short, one side is longer than the other.
B004JKIQR6	it fits my ear, and there is no setup needed.
B004JKIQR6	This is a good product, and comes with an adapter to work with 2.5mm or 3.5mm.  Also has additional clear rubber pieces of different sizes.  It works well, clear audio both directions, tested with someone to make sure they heard me clear.  After shipping, I paid seven dollars, so five stars considering price too.
B004JKIQR6	Have had this earpiece for sometime.  It has been used with two different cell phones and my home wireless handset.Sound is clear and microphone pics up all of my side of the conversation.  Would buy again!
B004JKIQR6	This earpiece works beautifully.  I bought the earpiece was for my husband who had tried one bluetooth after another. We decided to give wired a try and now we can hear clearly. He liked it so much I bought one for myself.This earpiece also works on my son's IPod and my Thinkpad tablet!  At this price I will probably buy a couple more to keep in the house.
B004JKIQR6	Instead of getting a bluetooth headset for the house that would have to be charged, this earpiece can be picked up at any time with no worries about charge or pairing. The volume and clarity are great and the earpiece is extremely comfortable.
