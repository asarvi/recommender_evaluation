B004ULZAMS	At last I can use my cell without worrying that will discharge fast. There is a huge difference. RECOMMEND IT.
B004ULZAMS	Today (01/23/2012) I receive my power pack.The smart phone fit pretty well, the materials and manufacturing looks fine.I recharge my galaxy s2 twice or three times by day and once by night. With the power pack I need only one recharge by night.Rarewaves has an excellent service. Five days ago I ask them what about the delivery of the power pack because it was delayed. Tehy explain me the issues of postal services when two countries are involved and told me "do not worry, we will take care about it". I'm glad, thanks.
B004ULZAMS	First, this is for the Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 model, if you are buying this to fit the ATT, Verizon, or any other carrier based GS2 they are all slightly different and this product may not work to your satisfaction.  I have had this connected to my phone The GS2 GT-I9100 for about a week now and have charged up both the phone and this case when first arrived and then only once more this past week.  It fits the phone perfect, you can feel the "click" when you clamp it down on the phone, haven't had any issues with it coming open at all.I wish it gave a little bit longer battery life..but this is a very very thin case with a very very thin battery in it so don't expect miracles.  I also like that it gives the phone a bit of weight too, makes it feel a lot more rugged and brings it up to about the weight of the iPhone 4.  It does make the phone larger in every deminsion but now I am not afraid that I will crack the phone if its in the pocket of my jeans.This is the best battery extension case out there for the GS2 GT-I9100, my only complaint is that the actually seller is located in the UK and it took about 3 weeks for me to receive this item.
B004ULZAMS	Poor Design.. Should have a switch to allow user to charge when needed... the moment you plug onto your phone, it automatically charge even when your phone is full... while when your phone is flat... it bearly can charge up to 50% before it is flat... Worst battery pack !!
B004ULZAMS	Bought for SGH-I777 the AT&T version and the case will not stay shut all the time. When it does the battery charged notification harasses you. Had to get an app to shut that off. The phones normal battery sucks "bad" so the added battery is great. I went from charging every half day to a single full day and sometimes 1 1/2 day. So it works good for me. It does not work if you want to charge a dead phone for some reason. You have to leave it on the the phone all the time. I called Samsung about it not staying closed and they could not even find out what it was. They finally figured out it is for Germany market and not the US. I told them that the box it came in was all English and they said well English is the universal language. So anyway, they will not warranty it in the US. Samsung really need to make a similar case for all these phones because the batteries cant handle the use.
B004ULZAMS	Excellent, I am very pleased with the article. It met my expectations at all meaningless.The article comes with the features listed on the page. I highly recommend itThe time of my battery now is considerably more extensiveThanks
B004ULZAMS	the item worked as expected and fits well with the phone; overall it helps battery life which is way too short on its own
