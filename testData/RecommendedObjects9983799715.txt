8199407050	The end you plug into the box had rust and green stuff in it.....????? Strange I wouldn't get one again unless I could see it first like at a store geesh!
8199407050	Never needed this one. Don't know how this charger was sent to me I did not order any wall charge for this type of phone.
8199407050	I wasn't especially thrilled with this charger because it doesn't make a solid contact and I have to wiggle it and hold it in place at just the right connection.  I thought maybe it was my phone so I tried it in my daughters phone and had the same result.
8199407050	This unit, the Wall/Home Charger for the LG Chocolate 3 was exactly the same as the original ... except! it was only about 20% of the original price.  Happy with the seller, unhappy that Verizon et al. mark up their products outrageously
8199407050	Just what I needed and at a very fair price. I love the versatility of using the USB connector or AC connector.
8199407050	We lost the charger for my wife's LG Chocolate phone while traveling. The charger for my Motorola phone works with her LG, but it was inconvenient to try to juggle time for recharging. Also, Lithium cell phone batteries can start fires if not charged with the right voltage and current, so it makes sense to use the right charger. I'm leery of the cheap "universal" chargers, for this reason.Amazon had the exact OEM model charger at a good price. It's perfect for the job, and quality is great!
8199407050	This was the least expensive option for a replacement charger and was very happy to receive the item so quickly. Thank you.
8199407050	The jack to the phone does not fit properly - generates an error message on phone but it does charge
8199407050	I bought this when my original charge broke.  This has been working faithfully ever since. No complaints about it. Like it just fine.
B000B6AAYY	I bought theMonster Mobile Ultra-Low Profile Vehicle Power Adapter for Motorola RAZR V3, A780, and Blackberrya while back and have been completely happy. After a recent trip with no power, I decided to track down a good charger for on the go. I ordered this based on my previous Monster experience. I am so glad I did.Why you ask? Simple.This charger is so freaking small. I had no idea and based on the pictures you won't either. The gold-plated charging "pins" disappear when you fold them into the adapter. Not only does it charge quickly, it's built like a tank and because of it's super-slim size, it fits anywhere.One of my best buys to date.
B000B6AAYY	Well-made and compact. Great value for the money at $5.95 and free Prime shipping. Better than other adapters that I have bought.
B000B6AAYY	amazing product...fast charging, super slim design. i don't know how monster does it but if can get your hands on one of these you should...it's amazing.
B000B6AAYY	This inexpensive charger at Amazon is great.  It's a really nice and thin charger, perfect for my laptop case for traveling.  Collapses quite a bit.  Works fine on my Motorola Razr cellphone and Blackberry Curve, since both have the mini-USB connector.
B000B6AAYY	item performs very well, slim size only lightens the load, but still takes up same space on the wall outlet or power strip, really could benefit from narrower design as well.
B000B6AAYY	I purchased this charger as an additional charger for my BlackBerry 8830. Unlike the OEM charger, this one comes with a plug that fits at a 90 degree angle to the phone, making it easier to use when the clearance to the side of your phone is restricted. Since purchasing this, it has replaced my OEM charger as the primary charger for my phone. Wonderful product!
B000B6AAYY	I used this for my Blackberry Pearl and the usb plug was real tight.  It actually made my OEM adapter too loose for my blackberry.  I thought it was just my Pearl than I tried it on a curve and the same thing.  So I ended up giving it to a friend who had razr and it fit fine.  I bought it off Amazon for real cheap so not a real big loss.
B000B6AAYY	It worked and it was under [...] bucks. bought it as a filler item. I would rather not support Monster. They are a pretty dirty company.
B000B6AAYY	Very slick device but does not work with Motorola Razr (even though this was advertised). Therefore, I had to return it. Overall very disappointing.
B000H391T6	Great product for the price.  Works great.  Cord is a little short but overall would recommend to anyone.
B000H391T6	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone. very frustrating.
B000H391T6	Love it. It works very well. Use it all the time when the phone needs charging. Will order again when needed. Thank You.
B000H391T6	I got the item within a few days. I like the service. And for a good price.
B000H391T6	I was nervous about buying a phone charger that cost a penny but I was happily surprised when it came in the  mail and actually worked. Sure it is more flimsy then the ones that you would by in the store but it does the job just fine for me!
B000H3BN9W	It worked wonderful. Thanks. I was surprised at the quality of the charger. I even recommended it to my friends.
B000H3BN9W	I really do not think that this is the charger that you are looking for. I sure found that out, I mean it fit my LG Fusic great, and charged about twice although after that it was shot. So I would suggest forking out a little bit more money and buying something a bit better.
B000H3BN9W	After a month of having this charger it stopped working. I had bought it for my Fusic LG phone and even though it was a good price it just stopped working after a month. Sad....
B000H3BN9W	This charger replaced one which was lost and works just fine. Delivery was fast and the price was right. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.
B000H3BN9W	At first, I was taken back by how cheap it was selling for. Since it was less than $4, I thought it was worth the risk. I have to say it's better than the one that came with my phone. At least this charger has a light indicator on the plug so you know it's drawing power. That's pretty good. This can't be beat for the price you pay.
B000H3BN9W	Just what we needed and just as expected when it arrived. An extremely affordable replacement home charger.  Worked like a champ!  Can't beat the price either!!
B000H3BN9W	Update 10-16-12:  Have had the charger about a month and it was working great.  Did notice that I had to jam it in a little bit to get it to work, but it was charging.  Well, today I tried to plug it in and realized that part of the charger had broken off inside my phone.  I am currently unsure whether either will ever work again.  Not good.
B000H3BN9W	just what I was looking for.  works perfectly and at such a low price.  I would buy from them again.
B000H3BN9W	I got this for a original VX9800 I have that I lost the power cord for. I got it in the mail and plugged it right in and started charging right away with no problems. The only downside I could see is it feels a little flimsy but they get the job done and as long as I don't go throwing it around or treating it like garbage they will last a while.
B000H3BN9W	Just what I was looking for an extra Home charge for my LG VX 9700 cell phone. Had one needed a spare to go. Great value. Richard
B000H3BN9W	This product arrived quickly, works perfectly for the cell phone I bought it for, and when considering the combined price of the item and shipping, cannot be bought elsewhere for the total cost or convenience.  I would definitely purchase this again if necessary.
B000NWJJFC	I got it to use with my pico projector and my flat screen tv.  It does a great job and was a great price. I recommend this product.
B000NWJJFC	This is working perfectly on my HTC Droid DNA.I can see a mirror image of my phone on my HDTV, including every app I tested.I can RemoteDesktop using Splashtop2 at FHD and the text is clear (as with my HTC Media Link HD test, the cheap old dell monitor, the text was fuzzy) and the delay is minimal.I can hear the audio from my phone's headset jack OR the HDMI output device. If I plug in headphones, the sound transfers to the headphones, if I unplug them, the sound transfers to the TV.It works just fine without power, but if I plug in a microUSB power cable, the phone does charge while the HDMI out is functioning.Out of curiosity, I plugged my OTG cable into that micro usb power port, but it did not work.As expected, HuluPlus is the one exception as they have disabled all video out on all Android Devices (except the Vizio tablet), including HDMI, MHL and DLNA.I received the one where the power outlet is parallel to the cord.I tried three different HDMI-less monitors and I could NOT get this to work over a HDMI->DVI adapter (tho there are MHL->DVI cables)
B000NWJJFC	After reading the somewhat mixed reviews on this gadget, I decided to gamble.  It turned out to be a great bet.  the phone is a HTC DNA and the display is a Pioneer 8500 head unit.  I was able to get video transmitted to the car stereo and it was great video and smooth as butta!
B000NWJJFC	I know MHL is a pretty new technology, especially to a majority of consumers.  But essentially, simply plugging in your phone into the adapter and then into an HDMI port on your TV allows you to watch and hear your phone on your TV.The one thing of note is that there are currently two MHL Adapter designs out there right now.  One model, the more popular one right now, the charging cable goes in perpendicular to the adapter and the other two connections, creating a T shape out of the cables.The newer model has all cables running parallel to each other, so the charging cable runs out the same end as the plug in for your phone.  IMHO, this creates a more streamlined length of cables rather than a big mess.The BoxWave cable, even though a few of the pictures show otherwise, is the parallel model.  I guess they got a newer version and just didn't switch the pictures.  But I ordered mine based on customer service assurances and was pleased to open the box to indeed find the parallel model.Either way, MHL is great technology.  I highly encourage the growth and development of it.
B000NWJJFC	WORKS GREAT ON MY REZOUND. I ALSO TRIED WITH MY DOCKING STATION WORKS FINE WITH JUST A LITTLE BUZZING SOMETIME. ALL AROUND I WORKS GREAT WITHOUT.
B000NWJJFC	After connecting this to the micro-USB socket on the HTC DNA and hooking in the second micro-USB connection to a power source, I was expecting to see output on the HDMI-connected monitor.  Checking some info on the web showed that the DNA may be able to output through the HTC connection only when doing a slideshow from the Gallery app or from a video.  Neither of these options worked either.
B000NWJJFC	This adaptor does not sufficiently charge the HTC Rezound phone while streaming. So if you start with a full battery you get 1-2 hours of streaming before the phone stops the stream and displays a message stating "The phone is drawing more current than the charger can supply.  Please shut down the phone immediately."  I tested this in two different residences in multiple electrical outlets in each one. I am using a brand new charger that works fine and charges my phone quickly when plugged directly into the phone.A few days after purchasing this adaptor I got an email from BoxWave asking if I was happy with the product and telling me that if I was having any issues I should contact them before providing Amazon feedback (BoxWave - are you worried about something?)  I let them know about the issues I was having and the message coming up on the phone's display when my Netflix movie streaming abruptly stops.  Instead of offering support they couldn't get rid of me fast enough. This product and this company should absolutely be avoided.
B000NWJJFC	When I first received this product, I didn't think it was compatible with my HTC Rezound.  That was 'operater' error on my part.  It works perfectly and I am able to connect my new mini projector to my phone.
B000NWJJFC	Ordered the adapter mainly based on price. I've looked at local electronics / cellular stores and the Verizon site since I bought the phone almost a year ago, never able to justify the high price or rude service for a gadget I expected to have to strong-arm into working.I was extremely pleased to get the cable about 4 days earlier than the earliest promised delivery date. Even more so when it just plugged in and started doing what was expected with no fuss or update required. Just connect to Hi-Def 42" Flat-screen and enjoy.Cable and adapter look to be good quality, reasonably heavy duty so should last at least as long as I'll have the Phone. Now I just need to pick up aParrot AR.Drone 2.0 Quadricopter Controlled by iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices -Orange/Blueand get it's Hi-Def feed recording to have my techno Air Force up and running.Great experience - seller inquired immediately to confirm delivery and resolve any problems - auto-generated follow up no doubt, but still another sign of the over-all professionalism I experienced in the transaction.
B000NWJJFC	The adapter was shipped fast and worked as designed. My only disappointment was not with the MHL adapter, but the fact that I cannot stream Xfinity from my phone to the TV. The minute you plug in the adapter the movie or show stops playing. There must be a security feature built into the app that senses an external output from the phone which disables play. The moment you disconnect the adapter, the movie begins playing again on my phone.
B002BH4PSS	The Universal Home/Auto charger is just what the doctor ordered, no problems when travelling, all in one what more could you ask for, and packs up like a little cube. It does the job I need done, at home and in the car. No worry about not being around a PC, love it so glad I got it. Nice and strudy also and comes with its own usb cord, what more could you ask for, and I love the blue light when it is charging.
B002BH4PSS	Nice to have a combination wall/car device when traveling - especially one with dual USB outlets. Nice design & material coating.The current listed technical description on Amazon as of June 8, 2010 is wrong. The back of the units states that the charger's inputs are 100-240V AC or 12V via the car and the USB output is stated as 5V, 1000mA.  Approximate dimensions: 5 1/8 x 1 3/8 x 1 3/8.  Weighs in at about 4 ounces.  A small blue light turns on when plugged in.It will charge an iPhone, it won't get an iPad to say that it's charging though...4 stars plus - would have been 5 stars except for its size.
B002BH4PSS	Wont support charging iPad. I have the original iPad and this charger won't support charging it for some reason.  Nice for travel as can use in car or home.
B002BH4PSS	This was a perfect addition to my travel accessories.  Worked as stated and I had no problems using the charger.
B002BH4PSS	Bought this a year ago and it's worked like a champ!  Great for traveling since it will charge things both in the car and in a hotel.
B002BH4PSS	I've only used this for my ipod shuffle, but got it because I eventually will use it with an ipod touch, and this is one of the only (or only?) chargers on the apple site that will do the range of ipods all the way down to the shuffle (and has 2 docks at that!), and here it's almost half the price as it is from apple. It works great in the car and the wall and has a very nice design by someone who cared about that kind of thing. I'm super pleased with it!
B005XT2URO	It came as expected and charges my phone batteries, but one of the two prongs that plug into the wall is loose and falls out when the charger is removed from the wall. This leaves a prong in the wall, which is dangerous if one were to inadvertently grab the prong to remove it. however, once removed and reinserted into the charger, it works again. Thus, three stars because it works, but breaks every time it is used.
B005XT2URO	If you have devises that use Nokia batteries and want to charge spares (I have a GPS dongle from Nokis that takes standard Nokia batteries) this is perfect. And it fits a wide range of Nokia flat batteries. The only thing to replace it would be one of the new multi-battery chargers for all forms of battery. If you have simple needs this will do very nicely.
B005XT2URO	After receiving the item I put it to immediate use to charge a battery and it worked perfectly. Still haven't used the USB port but I expect the same result. It also shipped fairly quick and I'm glad for the purchase.
B005XT2URO	I HAVE AT LEAST 7 OR 8 BATTERIES FOR MY NOKIA 5310 & I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ALWAYS CHARGED & THIS DOES IT.
B005XT2URO	Real happy with this unit.Lights up pink while charging and turns to blue when finished.Very nice having a back up charging system.My smart phone eats batteries for lunch.
B005XT2URO	This Product looks and works as just as described. I have no problems with it and I am enjoying it.
B005XT2URO	Bought this charger with hopes I could always have a spare fully charged battery at hand. After charging the batteries I had I began to question the charging ability of this unit as any charged battery from it seemed to last much shorter than using my phone's charger.Then after just two weeks of use, the charger died. No light when plugged in - DEAD. I took it upon myself to open it up to see what happened. After removing the three screws from the case there was a black wire hanging loose that had come undone from the printed circuit board. I resoldered the wire and also resoldered the red wire on the same board because that looked like it was about to come off. These wires connect the AC plug to the circuit board. What Chinese junk! QC is terrible. I find it hard to believe we can't make a unit like this in the USA. What's wrong with this picture?Anyhow, the charger is back working again, but I still doubt its charging ability. Buyer beware!
B005XT2URO	It's working well so far and as described.  The only shortcoming is that it takes about four hours to charge the battery.  Since the USB port broke on my Nokia N900, I have no other way to charge its battery, so I can't complain.
B005XT2URO	This is just as advertised.  Not too difficult to rate - either it works or it doesn't.  It works.  The only reason for a 4 is that the prongs are subject to breaking over time, but that's expected for the convenience of them folding in.
B005XT2URO	It has definitely served its purpose charging up my extra batteries. It let's you know when the battery is full again but the change of the light from pink to blue
B005XT2URO	The charging port on my little old Nokia had broken, and I can't afford a new phone, so I needed another way to charge the battery.  This and a second battery mean I never have to worry again about getting stranded in a broken down car with a dying phone battery.  (This happened TWICE before I got this unit...)
B005XT2URO	Inexpensive and works great.  I keep a few batteries for my phones.  I prefer to swap out a dead battery with a fresh one so my phone's not tethered to the wall.  This little charger helps out a lot.  When a phone battery dies, I replace it and pop the dead into this charger for a few hours.The charging indicator light is a quite bright (the only negative I can think of right now), but I only plug it in when I need to charge a batt.  It starts off red to show it is charging, then turns blue when the battery is fully charged.  The prongs fold in so you can toss it in a bag to travel with.  It charges both of my Nokia phone batteries - BL-5K and BL-5F.  I have no doubt it will charge most others.
B005XT2URO	I bought this after two other &#34;universal&#34; battery chargers didn't work for me.This fit my specific phone battery and I use it all the time to charge my spare battery so that I can just trade out batteries when my phone gets low. (My charger port broke and I didn't want to replace the whole phone). The color changing light is a great indicator of full battery. I highly recommend.
B005XT2URO	This item came with NO instructions.  Was not able to charge battery without the phone which made it useless to me.
