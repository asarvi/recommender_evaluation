B004L1VXEG	The case is billed as fitting an Atrix 4G MB860.  It does not fit the larger Atrix HD.  Attempts to contact the company to replace it with one that would fit have failed to date, in spite of emails direct to the company and thru Amazon.  I'm upset because the case looks great.  Would love to find one that works.
B004L1VXEG	I bought this belt clip to move the phone from my pocket to my belt.  The phone fits fine despite me using this protective case from TPU:  [....]The magnetic flap is great, sort of closes on it's own once it's close enough.  The horizontal positioning is great as it allows for more movement vs a vertical case.  Overall a great buy for the Atrix.
B004L1VXEG	I ordered this case with the *Rubberized Shield Hard Case - Hot Pink (Free HandHelditems Sketch Universal Stylus Pen)*  I was wondering if the case would fit with the snap-on case installed on the Atrix, and if it didn't at least it was cheap. But they both fit perfectly inside this case. It protects the phone really well inside my purse and from drops. I don't use the belt clip feature but it is there for anyone that would. I would recommend this to any Atrix lover &lt;3
B004L1VXEG	I ordered the "GTMax Black Horizontal Large Slim Leather Pouch Case with Belt Clip for AT&T; Motorola Atrix 4G MB860" from CrazyOnDigital first then they shipped me the wrong case. Shipped it back on my dime. Then brought another one from electromaster, they sent me the wrong one called Luxmo case. Fortunately it fit my Motorola Atrix w/ Otter Box Commuter. So I'm happy.So really I can't tell you anything, since two vendors sent the wrong case. So that tells you that you order at your own risk, and hope they send you the right one.
B004L1VXEG	Pretty near perfect for my Atrix. Photo does not show the belt loops on either side of the clip that further secure the case from popping off your belt.
B004L1VXEG	This case was so inexpensive I was concerned that it might not be good quality.  I am glad to say my concerns were not justified.  The case is well made, from quality leather, it has a good magnet to hold it shut and the phone fits perfectly.  It's exactly what I was looking for at a great price.
B004L1VXEG	The phone case is a nice and simple. Clean look..., not for high fashion people. The case is not high quality but price low enough to hold you for a short time.
B004L1VXEG	I ordered the GTMax Black Horizontal Large Slim Leather Pouch Case with Belt Clip for AT&T; Motorola Atrix 4G MB860 but when I got the package it was NOT the item on the pick ticket nor in the envelope. I contacted the company (repeatedly)and said it was not the correct item it was for HTV EVO. I was told it is correct it is universal. I said AGAIN it is not what it is in the picture that I picked and not the description I asked for GTMax Black Horizontal Large Slim Leather Pouch Case with Belt Clip for AT&T; Motorola Atrix 4G MB860. I was told it is correct to attach a photo, if it doesn't match. SO I took pics with my cell and emailed them. They have credited me.JUST BEWARE THIS IS SOOOOOOOOO NOT THE ITEM THEY KEYED IN ON THE PICK TICKET AND SOOOOOOOOO NOT THE ITEM THEY SENT TO ME.............(Sold by: CrazyOnDigital)Amazon was great assisting me in rectifying the problem with  CrazyOnDigital
B004L1VXEG	This pouch is something I needed for work since I have to wear a duty belt and have no room for a bulky phone like mine in my pocket. This pouch exceeded my expectations by 100%! I expect something so inexpensive purchased from Amazon to be cheap, flimsy and poor quality but this thing is great! I use an Otterbox Commuter case on my Atrix so I thought I'd have to remove it to get my phone to fit in this pouch but it fits perfectly with the Otterbox. I imagine it may be slightly too big for just the phone but it is pretty close.
B004L1VXEG	cheap and it fits my Atrix with silicone case perfect!  Fits securely on my belt.  Synthetic leather, but looks and feel like the real thing. Buying another one for back-up.
B004L1VXEG	It is good.  I have it for more than 2 years until the leather cover the metal belt holder torn a part.
B004L1VXEG	I was expecting to get what I paid for.  I was pleasantly surprised! Don't let the low price fool you this is a quality case with the look and feel of real leather.  The magnetic flap holds your phone securely in the case and the two belt loops and belt clip will hold the case securely to you, your bag or whatever you choose!
B004L1VXEG	I dont think this product is of the highest quality, but is cheap, and gets the job done. No one could be dissapointed, it delivers
B004L1VXEG	Provides protection while keeping your phone accessible. Even acts as a bit of a cushion in case you drop your phone or that accidental fall.
B004L1VXEG	The case intially seemed nice, I use it with my phone for a while but the stitching was poor and the belt clip came off within a few months.
B004L1VXEG	This case is 100% good. Strong, comfortable and safe.
B004L1VXEG	This case was supposed to fit with a tight skin on. If you want to use a skin, then this case will not fit. I bought the TPU soft gel case cover and with it on, you cannot use this case. Case is well built but will only fit the Motorola Atrix if you don't skin it. Poor rating is not for quality but for fit.
B004L1VXEG	This is a good case for a really low price.  It's a solid value item. Materials, stitching, magnets which keep the flap closed, are all of good quality.
B004L1VXEG	I bought this after reading positive reviews from users who claim to use Motorola Atrix with TPU case. It appears that they are not real users! Motorola Atrix with TPU case does not fit in this leather pouch at all.
B004L1VXEG	I was looking for a leather pouch case for my Motorola Atrix.  This case fits the phone perfectly and so far I am very pleased with it.
B004L1VXEG	Fit my Atrix perfectly even with a protective skin installed.  The hook I used to attach this to my belt ripped off after about 2 weeks of use, so now it's useless to me.  At least it was cheap.
B004L1VXEG	The case was fine. However I cannot use it, I didn't realize my phone wouldn't fit in the case if i had one of the rubberized cases on it.  As far as the case itself, it looks nice and was what I was looking for, just cannot use it.  The price and shipping price was great.  I would recommedned this site to anyone.
B004L1VXEG	I received this case on time and in good packaging from the seller.  It is a good fit for my Motorola Atrix 4G phone.  I use a gel case too, so it is a little tight which is ok considering.  The case seems to be made well and offers good protection for my phone.  I got it on Amazon, so the price I paid was great.  The case looks great too and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I would certainly buy again from this seller and recommend this seller and this product to anyone who is looking at this case.
B004SFVHFU	This is a great case. It is colorful and fits well. The case protects the phones most vulnerable points. i would buy this again. great value.
B004SFVHFU	The design is just as it looks online. I really like this one. The one I got didn't fit perfectly but the seller was good about getting me a new case. The price was excellent too.
B004SFVHFU	I bought this for my teenage daughter. If you drop your phone a lot, like most teenagers do, the case will come apart & chip off.  Eventually, it won't stay together on your phone anymore.  Get a gel case.
B004SFVHFU	I really liked it but then my phone was not working correctly and I had to get a different one so am not using it
B004SFVHFU	Got this protector for my wife cell and she loves it makes her phone looks really nice, and protected it every time the little boy let it dropped, good purchase thanks guys
B005SG6RE4	Just what I needed to protect my phone, great color, that I can change up when I want too .
B005SG6RE4	The cover fits well and the holes line up perfectly.  Like the slightly rubberized feel since the phone is a bit slippery otherwise.  Some other reviewers mentioned it was difficult to access the side and bottom keys but I have not found that to be an issue at all.  The tool included makes it easy to remove the case.  Great price.  The shipping charge was the most expensive part.
B005SG6RE4	Case fit just as I needed it too for my Tracfone.  The blue is a metallic looking blue.  Reminds me of a sports car paint color.  Looks better in person!
B005SG6RE4	Perfect fit, awesome color, iridescent blue.  Thought it came with a tool to open it back up, but it wasn't in my package. Probably can just use a plastic knife.
B005SG6RE4	this phone case is really cool its lime green not that really lite green it comes with a handy tool to take the case off. its blocks the phone from getting any dents its hard but a little rubbery at the same time!
B005SG6RE4	Great product.  Looks nice too.  Protect my cell phone very well, and keeps it in good condition.  Love the color too!
B005SG6RE4	I got one of these for my tracfone, hoping too be able to see it more easily in the depths of my bag. When my sister bought the same phone for herself  I recently,I could see her having similar problems-black phone in black purse disappears from sight. So I looked for a bright color protector for her. She loves the color, and likes the way the case systems to protect her phone, giving her a better grip on it.I have only one complaint. This newer cover does not fit as snugly and seems to be a bit carelessly constructed compared with my older cover on my phone. We had to carve out the opening for the charge port and there is a crack along  side of her case where the  front and back pieces come together. We carved, and all seems  to work well enough for now.
B005SG6RE4	It's like a whole new cheap phone, wearing this hard plastic dress like a Tracphone Bjork.  Click it a bit harder if it's not fitting, it's actually nicer than I thought.
B005SG6RE4	Kept dropping my phone because it was so slick - now I can hold it comfortably, and the case fits it perfectly. All keys are still accessible with no problems.
B005SG6RE4	I ordered this for my LG530G phone...it is made for the LG500 phone and does not fit mine...Why would someone advertise it fits the 530G when it doesn't...I don't think they make one for the 530G as I have not been able to find it...
B005SG6RE4	Arrived before expected, looks like its rubber in the picture but it is actually hard plastic, fits my phone wonderfully, very nice change, now i look like i have a totally new phone, would recommend to friends, will probably buy another in a different color. maybe even have one color on the front and one color on the back :)
B005SG6RE4	This product is great and it looks perfect and feels smooth and it is also kind of hard to take off if you want.
B0066ECWWS	I really love this case, but after about two months of use, it fell apart. I am not too upset, given the price, and I enjoyed it while I had it, but I don't know if I would buy it again.
B0066ECWWS	This cover is great!! It doesn't peel or feel like the color could come off, high quality thick phone cover!!
B0066ECWWS	3 stars because it's and absolute NIGHTMARE to get it off to do a battery pull or cleaning.  Very bulky but my 11 year-old has no other complaints.
B0066ECWWS	It was in great shape and is cute!!! :)  it fits great and i love the material that it is made out of!
B0066ECWWS	I love the price and looks of my new cover. I love finding greats deals like this and plan to remember this site to order future needs.
