B004BIY59O	I love it, Have not forgotten my cel phone not one time since I have purchased. I recommend to all whom have busy lives.
B004BIY59O	This little gadget (left in the trunk's 12v plug) works as expected most of the times but it takes a few seconds to do the discovery which itself isn't all that bad but sometimes (about 1 in 5) it gives out a false alarm (1 short annoying beep). Thankfully, in another few seconds it discovers the phone and emits the positive (3 clean beeps) tone so all is not lost but it would be nice if they can fix the false alarms.
B004BIY59O	I took off one star for the hassle of trying to figure out what code to put in when my phone asked for it. A google search suggested 0000 and that worked. That aside, Bringrr preforms as advertised. Worth the cost if having your cell phone is a must and not just a convenience.
B004BIY59O	This has been very helpful to remember that I didn't have my phone on me.  Took off 1 star because the front caved in a bit when pushing it in, when I didnt think it was all the way in.  Still works - just push it in from the outside; not your thumb.
B004BIY59O	THIS DEVICE IS TRULY A GREEN DEVICE. I WOULD LEAVE MY PHONE AT WORK AND HAVE TO GO BACK FOR IT MOST OF THE TIME FROM HOME. I WOULD LEAVE MY PHONE ON FRIDAY WHEN WE WENT SHOPPING AND THE PHONE WAS HOW WE WOULD FIND EACH OTHER IN THE STORE. NOW NONE OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS DEVICE GOES RED AND STARTS COMPLAINING RIGHT AWAY. I HAVE SAVED MORE GAS WITH THIS DEVICE THAN I PAID FOR IT ALREADY, NOW I CONSIDER THAT IT'S MAKING MONEY OR SAVING IT HOW EVER YOU SEE IT BUT IT'S THE GREENEST DEVICE I HAVE. I WOULD SAY THAT IN A YEAR I WOULD SAVE ENOUGH GAS TO PAY FOR A TRIP TO GO ON VACATION A COUPLE HUNDRED MILE AWAY EASY. IF YOU LEAVE YOUR PHONE A LOT THIS DEVICE WILL PAY FOR IT'S SELF MANY TIMES OVER!!
B004BIY59O	This gadget has saved me many trips back to the house for my phone! Great price, great purchase for those who are forgettful! Love it!
B004BIY59O	I bought the Bringrr out of frustration, having on many occasions that empty feeling when you figure out that you phone is not where it should be. Often times I'll put the phone in my turnout gear during an EMS call. Back in the car the Bringrr begins to chirp, way before I get miles away.Thanks for the innovation.
B004BIY59O	Setting up the device was difficult because the messages about not being connected were wrong. It's unfortunate that the site doesn't offer a good how to video. I found one on youtube which solved the problem.One suggestion for a already useful product:Include a super capacitor or some other way to allow the unit to provide a warning when you leave your car to take your phone. It could emit a few beeps or some speech. I find I also frequently leave my phone in the car as well as at home.
B004BIY59O	I am very pleased with my Bringrr.  It has saved me several turn around trips in heavy traffic.  You forget it is there until you start your car, when it beeps to confrim your phone is present or really beeps when your phone is still on the counter, in the house or office.
B004BIY59O	Couldn't  get it to work with an EVO 3D or Samsung S3.  I am very techy.  Lights come on, but never like the manual describes that they should.  Does nothing when I get in or out of vehicle with phone, except blink with a blue light.  Same blink whether I have the phone or not.  If I exchange, I'll let you know how the next unit does.
B004BIY59O	We never got to use it because it was not compatable with my husband's car. The placement of his outlets (behind a little door) would not have helped him, so he decided it wasn't for him and we sent it back.
B004BIY59O	I agree with the other reviewers that this is an extremely well designed and useful product.My problem with it is that a couple of times now,the bringrr has remained completely dead when I got in the car.I know it is connected to power, because I have an iphone car kit plugged into it,and it lights up.I have attempted emailing their support several times but have yet to receive a response.I will update this review if I do get a reponse.
B004BIY59O	This is a must if you forget your phone a lot.  I got this as a gift and thought it was kind of a joke since I forgot my phone a lot. But it turned out to be one of the handiest tools I own.  With smart phones you're always looking things up and then you put the phone down in front of you. With Bringrr, as soon as you start you car it lets you know if it detects your phone. It works great and saves me the trouble of turning around and going back to get the phone. I highly recommend it.
B004BIY59O	Received a Bringrr for my iPhone 4 in Spetember and it never worked. It never broadcast a bluetooth signal. I tried to resolve it through several phone calls to the developers who claimed they were sending me a new one. I never received a replacement. Don't waste your money.
B004BIY59O	It seems to work because it bleeps red almost everytime I get in the car so that reminds me to look for my cell phone, but I thought the idea of it was to just signal red when you don't have it in the car.
B004BIY59O	Very useful, well designed gadget! Unfortanely probably underpriced or marketed poorly. I would pay twice as much for a replacement!
B004BIY59O	This is junk, it did not work at all and I am PC savy so it was not me. I even checked to ensure that it would work with my husbands' blackberry and it didnt. I returned it but I had to pay a re-stocking fee, probably how they make their money; hoping you wont return it.
B004BIY59O	My daughter bought one of these for my husband and it has saved him several times.  He has to have his phone because he conducts alot of his business over the phone.  I have been leaving my phone at home several times lately, so I thought it was time to get one for myself, so I just ordered one for me.  Don't hesitate to buy these, they really do work!
B004MBP3ZU	I ordered from this link and received a charger NOT made by HTC, even though the description says "by HTC" right under the product title, a clear misrepresentation. I have no idea if it works, as I returned it for a refund, since it is not what I ordered.I would like to purchase a charger that's actually made by HTC; have other customers had the same experience? Is there a link to an actual HTC OEM charger?
B004MBP3ZU	This is a great car charger. It works exactly like it should and we couldn't be happier with the product!
B004MBP3ZU	Works as advertised. Glad I saved money buying through Amazon. The part that gets plugged into the car power port does get kind of hot but I never use it for too long.
B004MBP3ZU	My wife has the same phone and we can charge both of our phones at the same time while driving.
B004MBP3ZU	This is a dual usb charger that I use in my car to charge my HTC...alhough it can be used for any micro-usb phone....good thing is that you can charge 1 extra usb based phone using this
B0062O258S	I use the MB612 (due for an upgrade soon) and these chargers work great...for a few months, just like most chargers.If you have a different, less destructive phone, read the reviews for those.
B0062O258S	There aren't many Android auto chargers that also have a USB output.  I now own 3 of these same chargers and they work great.  Be careful buying other chargers.
B0062O258S	This is an excellent product for the person who on the go most of the time. This plug fit's in all car plugs that i have been driving or riding inside of.Get this!!!
B0062O258S	This is a manufacturing issue, not the seller, a trouble whit the contact pin at the time to plug it in the car socket, i try different cars and nothing!! looks really nice, but useless!!
B0062O258S	I finally wised up and quit buying those cheap off brand power cords.  They would 'mysteriously' fail after only a few months. The Sprint cord has proven to be well worth the investment!
B0062O258S	Nice to be able to charge my phone in the car. Good quality and great price. Arrived fast and better than expected!!
B0062O258S	Great charger for the car, coiled cord is a little annoying and would have preferred a straight cable but a good deal none the less.
B0062O258S	We've had it for 4 months and it holds up and continues to work. Note the convenient full size USB port, too. Very nicely done. Kudos to Amazon for offering these parts at a considerably better price than the Sprint stores!
B0062O258S	It's a really good car charger i really like the blue LED lights when it's charging it works great with the SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2
B0062O258S	I can actually charge my phone and fitbit at the same time with one outlet. Love it. It looks nice
B0062O258S	work great, I am able to charge two device using one socket.  I was able to charge several different type of tablets and ipods from the usb port with no issues.
B0062O258S	Got this for my husband so he can charge his phone in the car. I love that it has a USB port in the top, so I can charge my stuff at the same time. We've had this for almost a year now and have had no problems. Great product.edit 7/9/13: the cord finally snapped, but we had it for around 1.5 years, so we feel like we got our money's worth.
B0062O258S	Excellent car charger for short money.Don't pay for the charger at the Sprint store, this is it for a lot less money.
B0062O258S	totally amazing charger with extra USB port on it! It is very nice and great price. I recommend this item for sure
