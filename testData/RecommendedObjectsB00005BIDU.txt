B003554BR0	Shipping was fast and easy and it was packaged very well. The headset itself looks great, nice curve design to it, feels really comfortable on my head. The ear cushions do a great job for comfort, I wore these one day for a few hours straight and it felt like they weren't even on my head! No pressure added on your ears, they don't make your ears "hot" and "warm", its very comfortable. As for sound, its pretty good! I tested a few audio recordings, the sound is very clear and crisp, at times you need to speak up but it picks up your voice very well. Audio playback on this headset is very good as well. Overall this is a pretty great headset for the price and feels good!
B003554BR0	I bought this headset at Radio Shack for something close to $50, and I can see why it has gone down in price. The thing is junk. I use it for work, and it crackles expectantly.I bought it because it has a little red light that tells you if the mic is muted, but still this is overpriced even at $25. It is big and bulky... and wired. For all of that, I expected it to have good quality and reliability.UPDATE 5/12 - I sent this back to the manufacturer some time ago and they sent me a new one. The new one works better, thank God.
B003554BR0	I had previously owned a Plantronics headset which produced excellent sound quality, but had an earpiece fall off after about two years. I bought this one thinking I could trust the name. Simply put, it has constant glitches in playback (it's not getting the signal properly from the computer) and it produces an intermittent clipping regardless of volume, as if the gain is somehow being overloaded. This is a problem that only occurs when using this headset, and not while playing back over other speakers or even cheap earbuds. I will not likely buy another Plantronics product in future.
B003554BR0	I have two kids that needed headsets, and I decided to go with Plantronics, first set I got was thePlantronics .Audio 646,DSP PC Headsetwith the behind the head setup, NOT GOOD for kids because of the smaller head size, kept falling off their heads...Replaced the .Audio 646s with the Plantronics .Audio 626 DSP over the top headsets and they LOVE THEM, they fit both adult and children's heads really well.The quality of the sound is great, when used with Skype it worked great, overall, GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE, PLANTRONICS makes another winning headset...
B003554BR0	During the first few times wearing this headset, I have to admit that it was definitely a little different and awkward. Many headsets are over the ear and is round, usually with the headband attached down the middle of the earpiece. Here, this Plantronics headset's headband attaches on one end of the earpiece. Essentially, it felt like I was wearing a headset backwards. Besides the minor adjustment, this headset has decent sound and microphone.The design is good and definitely not cheap. The headband is felxible and makes the chances of breaking less likely. It also sits on the head very lightly and can be worn for long periods of time. You may also flip up the microphone when not in use. It's not intrusive when flipped up. The chord isn't the strongest, but is definitely good enough for a casual, at-home, or at work use.As I had mentioned, the sound isn't too bad, but there's not much thump or bass. The microphone is fairly good, clearly capturing my voice. It's good enough for some casual voiceover recording, skype/videochat, and for work.Overall, not bad, it's lightweight, comfortable, and fulfills basic needs.
B003554BR0	I bought and returned a Logitech USB headset because the sound quality was really poor.  Using internet calling, I could barely hear the person on the other end.  Logitech might seem fancy on the outside but it's a piece of garbage on the inside.  After purchasing the Plantronics, oh my goodness... it just blew the Logitech away.  The sound is much louder and beyond audible.  It's perfect.  If you'd rather get performance over build quality, get the Plantronics.  It may seem a little flimsier but the sound quality is 100% better.  Amazing product!  Thank you Plantronics for not ripping me off.
B003554BR0	The microphone audio quality is perfect for VOIP or gaming, clear with great noise cancellation. The headphone audio quality is acceptable, about as good as my cheap Sony 3.5mm headphones. The "boom" with the microphone can bend, letting you move it closer or farther from your mouth.The headset is very comfortable, with adjustable height and soft foam earphones. There are 3 buttons on the headset, a mute button and two others which I've never used. The mute button lights up red when muted.Overall, for ~$30, which is about how much I paid retail and the current price on amazon, it isn't the cheapest USB headset, but if you need something good, it's worth it.
B003554BR0	headset is relatively nice. not a great design but fits well and is comfortable enough. microphone works very well. i also like the mute button which shows a red light when you have the mike on mute. sound quality is actually pretty good but not top of the line. overall great headset for the price.
B003554BR0	I bought this headset because I had 3 logitech headsets short out on me all in less then 12 weeks. I have not had this long enough to know how it will last so I will just talk about what I have noticed. It is light weight, and can be worn for hours without bothering me. The mic works very well. The sound is so so, could be better could be worse. The controls are the same could be better could be worse honestly I prefer controls on the ear, but only Plantrinics I saw with this was noice canceling which I do not want. Overall very good for the price I would easily suggest this headset for anyone looking for an under $50.00 headset.
B003554BR0	Let me start off by saying, I bought the 626 in a store a year ago and paid almost $20 more than Amazon is currently listing it at, and I still think it was a great deal. I use my headset for a lot of stuff, recording and editing audio and video, skypeing, gaming and online graduate courses and this has been so much better than my previous head set. I'm comfortable with technology but not really what you'd call a techie.  But from a layman's perspective, I sort of see technology like wine, in that you're likely to notice the quality increase between a $12 and $25 bottle more than you would between a $25 and $50 bottle. I jumped from basic head-set ($20-$25 range) to the 626's range (I paid in the $40s). While the sound was a big improvement, the quality of my output for recording jumped 10-fold. Comfortable, simple and easy to interface with, this was worth the extra $20 for sure.  At this price I'm tempted to buy a second one for my laptop. If there is any negative it's very small, I wish the volume buttons were marked better, I'm always decreasing volume when I mean to increase and visa-versa.
B003554BR0	With the Plantronics name you would expect this microphone and headset combo to produce good quality sound and it does deliver. The sound is clear and easy to understand what others are saying and the person your talking to can hear you clearly as well. Installation on my computer was a snap. Basically I plugged it in and my Mac found it and started using it right away without any trouble. My only dislike on the product is level of comfort. A previous Plantronics headset I had the headphone speakers were able to flex and move a bit adjusting to the angle of your ears so it was equal pressure all around. This headset does not allow for that (headphone part is attached directly to the band) so its not nearly as comfortable to use for extended periods of time. This might be okay if it was an over the ear design but since it sits directly on the ear and has little padding it gets annoying quickly. If you intend on using these for more than short periods of time or daily I would step up to a better model that offers a bit more comfort.
B003554BR0	We have been using this headsets and they have proved to be excellent value for money, with good sound quality
B003554BR0	I purchased this headset to replace a logitech headset that broke after one month of use. The sound quality is better and the noise canceling more effective then any other headsets in this price range I've owned(and its been many). The ear cushions are a solid piece, not the ring style on most headsets I've encountered, which I fins more comfortable. There are reviews stating that they fins this item uncomfortable. I wear a headset about 9 hours a day for work as well as other computer apps at home, and I've experienced no discomfort with this model.The headset also expands to the largest size of any headset I've experienced, a huge plus if you have a large head.
B003554BR0	They sound nice and clear and the mic sounds good. I found them to be reasonably comfortable. But, I bought these for call center work and the soft phone system we use requires a USB headset with a little more gain to sound loud enough, even with the computer and headset volume controls all the way up. These don't block out external noise very well, making the weak audio an even bigger problem. I'm saving these as an emergency spare and dreading the day I'll have to use them and not be able to hear my customers again... lol. I am still using Windows XP. I've been told the newer operating systems use different drivers and settings for USB audio devices and more gain may be possible.These did work excellent in other applications where the audio wasn't weak. I'm now using the Plantronics 655, which does have a little more gain and they block out more external noise.
B003554BR0	Ordered two of these - one worked and the other one was just garbage. No audio and the noise canceling mike did not work.
B003554BR0	Starting with the package, it was VERY hard to open.  I used scissors, but they went dull after finally getting it open.  And the plastic is very sharp once you finally do get it open. The headphones are worthless.  The ear pieces are small, and they don't lie flat against the ears so it's impossible to get good sound out of it.  I really regret buying these, and I looked a long time before finding ones that I wanted.
B003554BR0	I found these (wired) USB noise canceling 626 headset worked fantastic for my use with Rosetta Stone and Skype.  They were a big improvement over the original Rosetta Stone headset that even work well in a really noisy environment.  Too bad they are wired, but they work really well!
B003554BR0	I bought this headset for use with my Rosetta Stone language software program and for music. I wanted good sound quality without a compromise in the microphone quality. I also demand comfort.I've had two headsets prior to my purchase of the Plantronics Audio 626. One of them did not have good mic quality. The likely reason for this is that it was not USB. If you want good microphone quality, you absolutely need to buy a headset with USB connection. This is because USB headsets are electronic to electronic sound signals. I can't get any more technical than that but if you want to know more about why USB connection is better, you can easily find articles on technology websites that will provide more details. Both of my previous headsets were uncomfortable for long periods. Actually, my first headset had very little padding.I began to wonder if I could ever find a comfortable, high quality headset that would fit my budget (I'm a college student). Every time I use this Plantronics Audio 626 I am amazed at what I got for my money. This kind of quality is worth well over $30!The sound is incredible for the price! I listened to many of my favorite songs to enjoy them again through these stereo-quality speakers. The guitar tones sound very clear.The microphone works perfect for my Rosetta Stone software! (I also plan to use this for Skype and I am sure it will work very well.) The mic boom is well-designed. It swivels and bends. At first I didn't realize it bends because it feels so sturdy!On the cord there is a handy in-line control with three buttons. One raises the volume, one decreases the volume, and the other button mutes the microphone. The mute button glows red when the mute is on.Now for the COMFORT! This adjustable headband is very durable and yet very light! You hardly feel this headset on your head. It does not squeeze the head like one of my previous headsets. And the earpads are soft, blue foam. They feel very good on the ears and I think they actually help direct the sound into the ear.Excellent product!
B003554BR0	This headset was easy to set up, plug and play and just easy!The set is lightweight and comfortable.  The controls are very easy to use and comfortably accessible.The sound and speaking quality is not perfect, but I'd say it's the best I've encountered yet in a headset of this style.The headphones adjust nicely, I have a smaller head and these adjusted down just fine!  I've had ones in the past that were too big and could not be adjusted down any further and they were still big, not the case with this headphone/microphone set.It will definately get the job done!
B003554BR0	Awesome is definitely not the word I would have chosen to describe this product. First I would like to start off my review by making the statement I did not purchase this device from Amazon.com. I purchased this device from my local Best Buy. After the purchase I came home and research Amazon.com and found that I could've bought the headset for about $15 cheaper at a price point of $29 as opposed to $45 in either case I feel that the $29 price point is more accurate to the quality of the headset. They do work for the intended purpose, but they lacked in comfort and fit and finish. For a $45 headset they just feel very cheap and not well made. But I don't want to speak all negatively about the headset there are some positive points the thing I did like most about the headset was on the USB cable there is a built in the mute button with two volume control buttons which work on PC as well as Mac.  The nice thing with the mute button is that it glows red when pushed so that you can tell that it's muted.This is a handy feature especially for my purposes with using this headset with Dragon dictation. I am possibly looking into getting a higher quality model of Plantronics headset through Amazon for the same cost I paid at Best Buy and return these to Best Buy
B003C6HGVA	In the one that I got, the microphone didn't work.  Maybe it was a lemon.  When I was talking on the phone, I could hear the other person just fine, but they could not hear me.
B003C6HGVA	I bought this for my son's LG Rumor Touch and he loves it. I just wish that it didn't have foam ear buds because those are so hard to find if you need to replace them--none of the stores around me carry them.
B003C6HGVA	Extremely muffled, tinny sound. Totally useless for listening to music. What else would you buy a stereo headset for? At this price not worth the hassle of returning it, so this POS went straight into the trash.
B003C6HGVA	I bought these for my daughter's LG Rumor Touch; for the price and what it does it's a great product, nice clear quality the only down side is that the earbuds are a bit big so they might be uncomfortable for some... great buy though!
B003C6HGVA	The sound isn't crisp and clear, but I can still understand people. For the benefit of keeping less radiation away from my brain, it gets a 3 star for effort.
B003C6HGVA	Unlike the 5 dollar headphones out there that sounded like an AM radio channel, this headphone is stereo for real!PLEASE PURCHASE FROM THE SELLER ORIONGADGETS, they sell genuine OEM headphones.I bought the headphone from some other company and the quality of music sounded so badly I had to ask for a refund and return it.I have been purchasing this model of headphone since last year.The reason why I kept on purchasing it is because they break after several months of usage.But I still come back and purchase them due to the excellent sound quality at a relatively low price (probably why it breaks after several months).However, most earbud headphones won't last, either it is 5 dollars or 40 dollars, so it doesn't really matter with me.I usually order 2 or 3 at once, and that's one year supply of quality music for me.
B003C6HGVA	They Came in mint condition just like the seller said. They matched the picture they came with something a little extra which was great. The headphones for LG RUMOR TOUCH came with little ear bud covers. It was a nice touch.. What they fail to state is that, the LG RUMOR TOUCH HEADPHONES are exactly the same as regular headphones just with the talk  button thing on it. The reason I even ordered the headphones was because I thought that it was going to have that tiny piece like other phone ear pieces. Other wise GREAT PRODUCT! If you have lots of music on your LG RUMOR TOUCH and want to listen to music and talk. :) 5 STAR!!!
B0055MPGHA	It worked perfected
B0055MPGHA	I got these to use with my Droid 3. I have other handsfree devices in the car but wanted to try earbuds with microphone. This works great. The microphone is imperceptible to the caller, The earbuds have a perfect tone and are very comfortable. I highly recommend it. It's a wonderful solution to the handsfree problem at less than $2.00.
B0055MPGHA	The strong point of these earphones are the fact that they are so comfortable and I have had them for over 2 months and they still feel like new....The sound quality is a mixed bag, it doesnt bring across bass very well and the music all around sounds kind of thin, but its not a deal breaker...some messing with teh EQ on my phone has helped with that....sound quality on voice calls are also excellent...and I am told I sound very clear as well
B0055MPGHA	The sound is so good I can use only one earphone for phone calls and for music and movies on my devices. However, I do use both ear pieces when listening to music. Luv the red.
B0055MPGHA	You canny go wrong with these. I got 2 pair one for me and one for my daughter. I use mine while mowing the yard they work greasy. Shes uses hers at work and likes them also. For the price a great buy.
B0055MPGHA	Sturdy and inexpensive. These are better for audiobooks or telephone conversation than for serious music listening.I constantly misplace my ear buds and the price allowed me to buy several pair.  there are better for music, but these are great for spoken word.
B0055MPGHA	just got these in the mail love the beat and the aluminum parts instead of the plastic crap of the same price i will be buying another set  if i can find them in gold
B0055MPGHA	I never remember to keep my bluetooth headset charged, so I needed a wired headset.  This is perfect.  Sound quality is great.
B0055MPGHA	Metal is heavy and scratches if bumped up against things.  Not that comfortable.  Cold in cold weather.  Sound was fine, but knurled metal housings simply not functional.
B0055MPGHA	These work great, better audio quality than your average bluetooth piece, and four bucks? I bought one for my office desk, my home desk, and my car. Love and definitely recommend. I will probably buy a dozen of these for replacements...they are just too awesome.
B0055MPGHA	The other party on call always complained about poor voice quality and feeble sound.I did end up using this as earphones for my radio.
B0055MPGHA	These are great! Everyone can hear me well and I can hear them. People like it better than when I use my blue tooth.
B0055MPGHA	I like them. I can't say they are just &#34;okay&#34;, because I would lile to have a red case to match them.
B0055MPGHA	Sound quality is not good. They look and feel great but their performance is terrible. I wouldn't recommend these unless you just want some cheap earbuds.
B0055MPGHA	This is perfect.  I especially like the microphone attached.  This one was purchased for me.  I keep it in the car and do not need to worry about if my Bluetooth is charged
B00788YU6M	Pros:Fantastic sound for the price. Clear audio with strong bass performance.iPhone/Smartphone control (volume control only works with iPhone so far).Aesthetically pleasingAbove average sound isolationCons:Cord is rigid (not a positive), but doesn't appear to be as durable as I would have hoped.Straight-style plug not ideal for my uses.While isolation is good, buds do not always stay put well in my ear (might be my ears' fault. I solved the problem by using the ear hooks that came with the SoundMagic PL-50's)Phone controls not easy to tell apart, as they're all flat and very close togetherFirst off, in my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons I wrote out for this product.  I was in the market for in-ear buds I could use for my iPhone that had volume control built in. That narrowed down my choices considerably.  I'm a fan of SoundMagic; I had purchased the SoundMagic PL-50 over a year ago, and the only way that product could have been better for me is if it had phone controls.  Although I do still prefer the overall sound clarity and signature of the PL-50 for everyday use, the E10M come close and produce a more &#34;fun&#34; signature that goes better with a lot of the rap/hip hop I listen to.  After a little burn in, the buds were ready to go and surprised me with the quality and clarity of sound at high volumes.  As a subway rider, the buds drown out most of the external noise as I can focus on either music or my talk show podcasts.I MUCH prefer the cord strength and texture of the PL-50 over the E10M.  I was hoping that the cord carried over to this model, but I was left disappointed.  They just don't feel as durable, and I question how well the cord will hold up long term. Also, after about a month of use, the cord still hasn't fully lost the curves left in it from the way it was packaged.  Its a minor annoyance, but I wasn't expecting the cord to be so rigid.  The buttons for phone and volume control are flat and hard to tell apart without looking. As I live in a cold weather location, perfect operation with gloves is almost impossible; I always need 2-4 tries until I hit the right button. Not a problem everyone would have, but I urge those of you with large fingers to look at products where the buttons are farther apart and more easily discernible.Overall, this is a good product. Build quality is great on the metal earbud casings, and I don't have any concerns about them breaking.  I'll give these guys a 4, but its really more of a 3.75 because of my annoyances. SoundMagic, if you're listening, please make an iPhone compatible version of the PL-50's where the volume and play buttons are farther apart!
B00788YU6M	Very greate and clear sound, for such a good price, now i can enjoy the music twice joyfull. powerful bass.One problem with ear buts, cant find the right ones, always fall out from my ears.
B00788YU6M	These phones are OK and provide decent sound. I was hoping for a bit more bass and more crispness but I don't really have much to compare with other $40+ earbuds. I tried them with every silicone and foam tips I could buy. Even those that provided the best fit still didn't overwhelm me. I'm tempted to try the Klipsch next time but not sure they would be a lot better. If anyone has a head to head comparison of these vs the Klipsch or Sony, I'd love to hear it.Update:  I finally found a set of ear tips that work for me - triple silicone going from very small at the tip to larger. Seems to provide a better seal than anything I've tried to date. Now the bass is definitely better. I've upped my star rating to 4.
B00788YU6M	The sound quality is great and highly responsive to equalization. I have not been able to test the microphone. The carrying bag keeps them untangled and protected from other items in my pocket. The volume controls do not work for my galaxy s5 (the product is for iPhone), but I can use the pause/next/previous button.Note: There is not a fix for making the volume controls compatible with android, it is a proprietary feature of Apple and works entirely different than similar Samsung earbuds.
B00788YU6M	Great for the price. Just feels like something's missing. Great highs and mids, bass is decent. Really worth the 40 bucks!!!
B00788YU6M	The gold color is not so impressive- would prefer silver(gunmetal) but was out of stock. Still 5 stars for balanced sound- quit importent since You don`t have much chances to play with the sound on many devices.
B00788YU6M	I can say it has a better sound than the earpod.not solid in some part of it, I replace one ....
B007FNYIXA	If the girlfriend loves then they are good Nuff said! and she a picky person trust me she like that.
B007FNYIXA	headphones were good quality for cheap price  it was nice and loud. i recommend buying these you will not regret it.
B007FNYIXA	Great, especially for the price. They didnt come with any different size rubberparts but that was fine because they were a good size for me.and the shipper was great. They came super fast. Will order again.
B007FNYIXA	Fits in my ear nicely and sounds great. The mic is good quality as well. I travel on the metro and bus often and I can hear my music clearly and phone conversations despite all the background noise. I purchased this dirt cheap so I was expecting low quality but functional. I instead got more than I paid for. I would def. recommend these.
B007FNYIXA	I love the look and the fit. The only issue is how loud it rings in your ear. You don't figure this out until your listening to music and the phone rings. The music level is fine but the phone ring actually hurts your ear.
