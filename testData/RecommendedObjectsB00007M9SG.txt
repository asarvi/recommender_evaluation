B001658CHQ	I bought this battery to replace the original in my old Nokia model 6010.  The transaction was simple and for about 6 bucks I had one delivered in about a week.  I am vey satisfied with the vendor.  The new battery takes a charge just as it should.  I would buy from them again.
B001658CHQ	The first battery when plugged into my charger showed no life at all, no battery bar, etc.  However when I left it in the charger for about an hour, the battery meter showed up and started moving.  My phone works in the cold now.  So wait for at least 2 hours if ya want to try to avoid frustration in thinking ya have a bad battery.  (I haven't tested it beyond about a month so..)
B001658CHQ	I was able to use my cell again!!! (till carrier said I couldn't use that perfectly good phone anymore). I will buy here again and tell my friends.
B001658CHQ	As another review mentioned, this replacement battery is slightly larger than the original, but it still fits in the phone just fine.  My previous battery (about 5 years old) finally started to die (would only hold a charge for a few hours, even though the readout on the screen reported a fully-charged battery).  I bought this replacement for a mere few dollars and now my phone is working great, again.
B001658CHQ	I was pleased to find the correct battery for my antique NOKIA phone.  Charged quickly and hold the charge well.
B001658CHQ	Very compact. Does not make a lot of noise when charging. Regular 110 plug. Easy to read and understand instruction. Meter on the front shows you progress of charge. Marine battery takes 5-6 hours to fully charge. This was a deep cell battery.Well worth getting.
B001658CHQ	I was ready to purchase new phones, when I found these batteries on Amazon.  It was like getting new phones again at a fraction of the price.
B001658CHQ	Don't hesitate to buy this product.  Good batteries, fast delivery, great price.  No worries.
B001658CHQ	It took a while the first package contained a battery for a Blackberry.The second battery arrived I charged it and it is working fine.Thank you
B001658CHQ	delivery was great.  BATTERY DOESN'T LAST 2 FULL DAYS BEFORE GOING DEAD.  AND THAT'S ON STANDBY
B001658CHQ	This phone battery is working fine. Have only had it a week or so, so too soon to tell how long it will last.
B001658CHQ	My Phone is an antique as cell phones go so I was afraid I wouldn't be able to replace the battery pack. Thankfully I found this one and my phone is back up and operational.Thank you!
B001658CHQ	I held off for a long time to find a new battery for my Nokia phone. I found the battery easily, and ordering was easy. Having it delivered to my home made everything easy. The battery works great! The phone works like new again. In the future I will be quicker to check with Amazon for any of my needs.
B001658CHQ	Great new battery, slightly thicker then original, but no big issue with this; keeps charge for 2-3 days.
B003B4C1K4	Met expectations, coupling is perfect for my cell phone, arrived in the promised time. Original product.I wish I could have a longer battery life.
B003B4C1K4	Bought from : Regain Computers thru Amazon - So other retailers might vary.  Had to click NEW and select the alternative merchant Regain.Battery shipped and was received within 2 days by USPS.  Very QuickTotal Cost was $12.49 after shipping.  Was looking for a 35H0123 battery to replace my HTC Touch Pro 2 batteries that just don't last a whole day.  Previous batteries were 35H00123-02M and generic china replacement batteries, none of them would last a whole day (24 hrs) no matter how I let them discharge then full charge.  Batteries just don't last long anymore, even the HTC batteries (I have 2 of them).Wanting a real HTC battery I ran across this OEM HTC Imagio Standard Battery 35H00123-11M 1500ma and figured lets give it a try, for $8 + $4.49 shipping I didn't have much to lose.2 Days later I received a 'Sprint OEM' battery, 1500mAh, 3.7V, 5.6Wh, Cells From Japan, Model BTDHS51115L, for use with Snap/Hero/Evo 4G.  I'm thinking great I got another generic battery that isn't going to last.  I went ahead and swapped it into the phone and let it fully charge for a few hours (was at 50% when I started, charged it to 100% green light in the phone).That was 48 hours ago!  With some phone calls, multiple email checking, web surfing, SMS messages, I've had my phone successfully running for over 48 hours!  I've never had this HTC Touch Pro 2 go this long!  % of battery left = 40% !!!  I plan to keep going to see exactly how long it will last but this battery definitely gets my vote to handle a high power device like the Touch Pro 2 for over 48 hours.  Backlight was set to 100% brightness too, although I normally use 60% I had left it in 100% for this particular test.So if you are looking for a battery for your HTC device and it uses the '35H00123' 1500ma series batteries, I definitely recommend this particular BTDHS51115L from Regain Computers.Update!! I was able to achieve a total of 68 hours of texting/web/email/some voice with this new battery before it hit 10% and asked to turn off the phone.  The % change was very consistent/linear from 100% to 10%, unlike my generic batteries that will go from 50% to 10% within 30 minutes.  Extremely happy with this Sprint OEM battery.  Two Thumbs Up!!
B003B4C1K4	The battery fit perfect. The performance time has been excellent. And the price was great. What more can i say?
B003B4C1K4	Looks OEM. First charge took about 4 hours but less after that. Holds life almost all 18 hours with normal use
B003B4C1K4	Better battery life than the orginal. battery. I can go all day on one charge. when i need another battery I know where to go.
B003B4C1K4	I have purchased battery to replace the original that came with my phone and they all failed me within a few months. This model has outlasted all the rest and with even more use then the previous ones . WAHOO! Well worth the cost.
B003B4C1K4	This Battery Meets and Exceeds expectations, it outlasts the original that came with my HTC Hero. i will definitely buy another soon.
B003B4C1K4	No problems.  Replaced a dying/malfunctioning original HTC battery and it performed just like the original I had from day one.
B003B4C1K4	The battery arrived promptly and appears to be working fine.  It does make a different using the OEM battery versus and after market battery with an insufficient rating.  Very pleased.
B003B4C1K4	Shipped fast and was a great price when compared to OEM batteries on other sites. Sort of makes me wonder if it's really OEM or a knock-off. Either way, it works fine; no problems.
B003B4C1K4	(I had bought counterfeit elsewhere for more.)These are real, they are new, and make the phone work like new!Well worth the money.
B00415UGQS	I bought this battery. Yes it was here in two days. But the battery also only lasted two. The battery exploded and ruined my phone with battery acid. So not only did i waste my money on a p.o.s. battery but now my env touch is destroyed. Do not buy this piece of junk.
B00415UGQS	The standard battery that comes with the LG enV Touch is not very good.  I ordered this extended life battery and could not be happier.  The battery has almost twice the battery life as the original, and it also matches the phone in color and design.  The only drawback (which I already knew before getting it) is that the battery sticks out about 1/4 inch from the back of the phone.  I knew this already so I was prepared for it.  To me I don't care.  It sits in my pocket about like it did with the original battery.  I would definitely recommend this battery to anyone who has the LG enV Touch.
B00415UGQS	Something happened and the battery didn't get here the first time, but they were very quick to fix it, sent a new battery, and it got here lightening fast.  The battery was brand new and I am thrilled with it!  Thank you for your professionalism!
B00415UGQS	I like the battery. I purchased two of them. I recieved them very quickly. The price was excellent. I only have one complaint. The batteries are thicker than the orignal ones that came with the phone. Once installed they are not flush with he back of the phone. But they work great.
B00415UGQS	Chose this to replace battery on existing phone.  Will help to add another year on phone life.  Best price too
B00415UGQS	I bought this item for my son and the products fits his phone but the phone will not accept the battery and keeps asking to replace it with the original battery and then powers down.  Do not buy
B00415UGQS	The product came in 2 days!! It wasn't expected to be here til monday and today is friday. Came fully charged and so far works great. It does stick out but with 2000 mAh I am not complaining. This thing should last a longgggg time!
B00415UGQS	I bought this battery because my stock battery from verizon only lasted a 24 hours on standby...but this battery is 2000 mah..over double the standard battery. This price was cheaper then any other battery.. I have been using this battery for 6 months and never had a problem and it last 5-7 days between charges....simply outstanding
B00415UGQS	Bought this for my mothers phone now she goes days without charging it! She loves it, because she's forgetful and half the time the phone doesn't make it from her purse to the charger at night.
B00415UGQS	Phone now carries a charge longer than with the original battery.  Still having problems with the phone turning off, but it doesn't seem to be related to the battery.  This battery will certainly help until I can replace the phone at my next upgrade.
B00501KBOY	Can't really get too excited about a cellphone battery.  It does what it's supposed to do, power my cellphone.  I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't hold a charge for as long as the original battery that came with my cellphone (same make and model) but since I don't use the phone that much, I can't really complain.
B00501KBOY	Holds charge and works like better than the original battery in my phone. Was what i expected when I recieved this item.
B00501KBOY	The battery worked perfectly. I was considering purchasing a five dollar battery, but after reading other peeps negative reviews about the cheaper priced ones i opted for this one. If i had bought a cheap one, i would have spent more money because i would have had to buy an additional battery, just to get something that works. So yeah, this 1 is great. The charge lasts just as much as the original's. I would recommend this to others :)
B00501KBOY	Can't find cell phone batteries for my old time cell, so this is great that I can order this way, they work great, and last as long as a new off the store shelf one.  Have ordered from here before, and always happy.
B00501KBOY	Battery came half charged.  I tried to charge it with the car charger and the house charger and it wouldn't charge.  I returned it and got a refund. I have had two bad experiences buying batteries online and found a store locally that sells new batteries.  I can't use my Verizon chargers with the store battery but I got a quality battery.
B00501KBOY	Works, but not much better than the one replaced.  Had other phones in the past where the battery lasted 3-4 days.  These Samsung batteries go down one or two bars during the day even if not making calls on the phone.
B00501KBOY	I had been researching the Samsung AB553446GZ battery for the SCH-U340 phone.  I was tempted to go with a "cheapie" one but after reading bad reviews I went for this one for $20.  It was worth the extra money.  It arrived fully charged.  I have had it for about a month and it takes a full charge.  I am very pleased that the seller, Accessory Distributor, is selling a new OEM battery, as described.  It did not arrive as pictured in a blister pack.  It was in a small zipped plastic bag.  It is somewhat difficult to find this battery because it is for an old flip phone from 2008.  I was a little concerned that the battery would not be good because of the poor shelf life of lithium batteries, but it works very well and I am very happy with it.  And it was cheaper than buying a new phone!
B00501KBOY	Still running great after all this time I do believe it's been over a year since I bought this battery for my husbands phone.
B00501KBOY	Bought this after being disappointed by the poor performance of a $5 "OEM". This the real deal.Most batteries are way overpriced, and I have always been completely satisfied with the quality of "budget" CR123s. The cell phone bargain battery market, however, seems to be dominated by shady companies selling used goods. Buyer beware.
B00501KBOY	I have to report that this one was a disappointment.  The battery looks just like the original and performs just like it.  Not so good since the original only holds a charge for three to four hours on standby.  This is installed in a flip phone, so no excess power demands.  You may get a better one than I did.
B00501KBOY	Read other customer reviews on this and other batteries and decided to go for this one that people said worked so well.  They were right and I am delighted that I didn't waste my money.
B00501KBOY	this is a great product, like the convenience to order online, I change batteries in our phone once a year and is good to have an extra, so will order more next year.
B00501KBOY	Bought this battery as a replacement for my moms phone. She went to verizon and they told her she would have to update her phone and sign another 2 yr contract. Saved lots of money and it made the phone work good as new. would buy again and would recommend.
B00501KBOY	This was just an on line purchase of an item we could not find otherwise.  It works fine.  Good source.
B00501KBOY	Works great, delivered on time.
