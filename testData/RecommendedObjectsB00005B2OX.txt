B003TLUV38	No problems with shipment, quick & efficient.  The product is clean & well made.  Fits my Samsung Reality very well.
B003TLUV38	Got this as a gift for my husband. He had already had 2 different cases that had either broken or didn't do the job. He likes this one and it keeps his phone more secure and protected than carrying it in his pocket!
B003TLUV38	I bought this carry case for my Samsung Rogue.  I had been having problems with the touch screen, which I believe is either from body heat or excessive force on the screen from being in my pocket without a carry case.  It is bulky to keep in your pocket, but I'm not the type to wear it on my belt, which is its intended purpose.  My Rogue is very tight in the case, but it fits.Bottom line is I wish it were a little slimmer, but my bad for not investigating closely.  Also, the lid is magnetic to help keep it closed, which is an added bonus.
B003TLUV38	Got this for new phone but used same (different model) with old phone for more than 2 years and held up very good.Never had a problem with it.
B003TLUV38	Did a decent job for me with three different phones at various times (a candy bar phone, a small slide-out keyboard phone, and an ancient clamshell with no camera that I sometimes carry when working in areas where cameras are not allowed). The problem that I had after 6 months (with this and several other previous cases of other styles and brands by the way) is that the belt clip is spring steel and riveted to a small plate buried in the case. The clip has a vinyl sleeve sewn over it. So first the sleeve gets cut up by the clip after a few months of normal use, and then the clip starts tearing out of the case itself after a few months.  Yet for the price, I don't feel too bad.The magnetic catch is fairly secure (seat belts on some car will open it and let the phone fall out though) and can be opened and closed very quietly when necessary, unlike velcro which is very secure or snaps which can wear out and be insecure and are sometimes noisy as well.I wish I could find a case like this for less than $100 wher the clip had smooth edges and the cover sleeve over it was more wear-resistant. Other changes to the construction would hep too, but that might be too much to expect from a bargain-basement product. I don't think I'll ever wear out the one my wife made for me, but I doubt she cold produce then economically for mass sale either.
B006HAJVD4	Great Product. Only Company that i could find that sells Flexible Cases for a Droid Bionic with an Extended Battery. I have boughten many cases since I got my phone in september. But Finally decided to switch to a flexible one because all my cases kept on breaking. So happy i switched!
B006HAJVD4	fits the phone perfectly. what you can't really see if there is a glossy edging done on the front for a little added style. the black of the phone shows through, but not enough to make it look purple or anything. good case.
B006HAJVD4	I found it very difficult to find a cover for my Bionic Android with the extended battery.  All that I saw were ugly and in black.  Being the girl that I am, I wanted something pretty and was very happy to find this one which I ordered in pink & purple.  While not blingy enough for my taste, they fit well, keep the phone clean & safe and are not ugly black.  I would definitely recommend this cover and provider.
B006HAJVD4	Got it for my wife and she loves it.. hard to find a case for the extended battey.. fits perfect and nice feel to it..
B006HAJVD4	Yes, yes, yes! This cover is perfect! Covers for my phone are like clothing - I like to change them out. THIS cover is my favorite. It just fits perfect! It feels good in my hand and it grips just enough that I can prop it up on my desk so the speaker is clear so I can listen to music.
B006HAJVD4	Fit my Droid Bionic with the extended battery just perfect. Can't ask for anything better! The pink color is nice, too.
B006HAJVD4	This case was exactly what it stated. It fits well with the extended battery and is easy to get on and off for placing in the dock that I have for the phone.
B006HAJVD4	This case fits my Droid Bionic with extended battery perfectly!  I love that it's a color other than black or smoke.  Please, please make this extended case in the glitterflex blue, or other glitterflex colors!  I also prefer the high gloss to the matte option.  Well worth the price.
B006HAJVD4	I purchased the extended battery for my Droid Bionic and this case was the only option other than the black one they sell.  It fits perfectly, in fact it fits better than the one I originally had on my phone that I purchased from Verizon (used it with the regular battery) and I'm not really a pink person, I do love the color.  I would definitely recommend this case to others, as well as the battery and the seller I purchased from!  I'm very, very happy with my purchases!
B006HAJVD4	I purchased this case for my wife.  She is a Sentsy consultant and likes the color and is very happy with the way it fits.
B006HAJVD4	I like it.  I don't know about the comment about it not being a normal pink - because I think it is.  But it's a nice color, and it's a great fitting case.
B006HAJVD4	I purchased the Hyperion 4000mAh extended battery and back cover.  It does not fit at all with this particular brand.  Do not buy them together.  It is a complete waste of my money.  It might be good for a different setup since it has all the right cut outs, but the shape of it doesn't work with the Hyperion back cover.  Darn!  I read a review of this that made it sound like this would be perfect for it.  I'm sad that it's not.  I like pink.  If you buy the Hyperion 4000mAh battery, don't bother with the Diztronic case.
B006HAJVD4	I have to say I was skeptical. I read the reviews but haven't seen many cases that actually fit the Bionic with the extended battery. This case fits like a glove, no slack at all. I bought the hot pink because my girlfriend is using my Bionic now, but if I had known how nice this case is I would have bought it in black a long time ago! If you are looking for a silicone case that fits with the extended battery, this one or the black one are the way to go!!!!
B006HAJVD4	The case is a perfect fit, way better than others I have seen on the market. Fits like a glove and it even protects it when I drop it (I do quite often)
B007JFNQFU	This case fit my Motorola droid Maxx perfectly.  Now it's not only easier to find in my purse but a little more protected.  Plus this case was a lot cheaper than those sold at cell phone stores.
B007JFNQFU	The case fit just fine.The only thing I didn't like was the color.I thought it was more a baby blue color.
B007JFNQFU	This case is WAY too cheap for the quality...much better than I had expected!  The blue is nothing short of gorgeous and the case fits perfectly!!!  It doesn't cover the screen lock or volume buttons like the others I had tried.  The diamonds are a groovy little touch.  My item got to me in a very short amount of time and I will definitely be ordering from this seller again!!!!!
B007JFNQFU	This case is great - It was cheap and it has protected my phone so much better than any other case I've purchased.
B007JFNQFU	I like the TPU cases, and I got several different colors for my phone, and I switch them regularly.  I liked this because it appears to be a LIGHT blue.  It is not.  It's darker.  It protects the phone just fine.
