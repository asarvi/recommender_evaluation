B000BLALEI	It's amazing...the best cost x benefits at earphones....there is no words to describe the quality of sound of this time piece....
B000BLALEI	I like these headphones, but am not as overwhelmed as I was expecting to be based on the reviews I read.  These phones deliver clear music, and the comfort is better than most others I've used (the Sony over the head inside ear phones I had before that came with a Walkman were the best).  I guess I was hoping for sound quality to be as good as an over the ear phone but it's not.If you're looking for comfort, something to use on the go, these are great.  If you're looking to reproduce a cinema experience then you should go for a quality headphone that covers your ear.
B000BLALEI	These A8's are very comfortable and soundfantastic.  The fit and finish are also top quality.
B000BLALEI	I have been looking to purchase these Bang & Olufson headphones for almost a year. After reading many reviews, I finally traveled an hour and a half to the store at King of Prussia Mall. I was offered to test the headphones with my ipod before buying them.The fit was absolutely amazing. There are 3 different ways to adjust the headphones so they fit your ear perfectly. When I was testing the headphones, the sound was great. I heard parts of songs that I never noticed before. I listened to my music for about 15 minutes, and then decided to purchase the headphones.They came out to be about $170 which is very expensive, but worth it for the fit and "sound quality". Not to mention these were supposedly the best headphones for an active lifestyle.  Because I run everyday and sought better sound quality than the headphones that came with my ipod, I thought I should treat myself.However, on the car ride home, I realized that I made a terrible purchase. I could hear the radio clearly through the headphones. I thought the problem could be fixed by simply turning up the volume. Now the volume in these headphones do not need to be turned up very high for the music to be loud. This is good, but with the increasing volume, the only thing that seems to get louder are the drums. There is no bass in these headphones whatsoever. J Kelly was right when he said that the headphones that come with the ipod have better bass. I read his review before buying the headphones, and did not listen. To anyone else who is thinking about buying these headphones, please don't waste your money.I have to now make time (return policy is 7 days) to drive another hour and a half down to the mall to return the headphones. Save your time and money and try something else.
B000BLALEI	I love these earphones. The trouble I had with my standard-issue earphones with my Nano was that my earpieces fell out when I was doing stuff. These have a collar which confortably attaches them to my ear. The sound is awesome. Like having my home Bose speakers in my ears...great sound. Tremendous comfort. Great value.
B000BLALEI	I purchased my first set of these headphones in 2000.I repurchased as I damaged the first set.At the time I thought they were great-sounding headphones.I used them principally with my minidisk players.Then when I started using iPods in 2003, I found the B&O; lacking in bass, actual loudness, and not extending far enough into the ear.  I actually thought the white buds that came with the various pods I've owned were better.That is, until I purchased a set of Sennheiser MX550 in-ear headphones.  I paid about $A27 for them.  The sound is amazing, perhaps only eclipsed by the B&O; in terms of clarity, plus they have a feather-weight volume control forming part of the cable. Before writing this review, I again tested one against the other and was entirely convinced the Sennheiser completely outperformed the B&O; - and at $A160 less.
B000BLALEI	I used Bang & Olufsen A8 headphones for a year walking around and running until someone stole them.Their virtues - excellent sound for small headphones that are not in-ear, look great, and stay on well.Their drawbacks - cost (although they are the best combo of the 3 virtues on the market), they take noticeable effort to put on each time because of the multiple ways they adjust, and the wires tangle with the hooks if one puts them in one's pocket.I had no reliability problems despite treating them poorly.I hope whoever took my B&Os; is still enjoying them.
B000BLALEI	This is my 2nd pair (1st chewed up by my dog.) This pair is the best I have ever had.  Comfort, sound - everything is perfect.  They are expensive, the only downside, but worth every cent.
B000BLALEI	The previous reviewer really hit the nail on the head.  The biggest problem with these earphones is the sound quality.  There is no richness, fullness to the sound at all.  It's quite tinny, no bass.  I've recently reverted back to my standard ipod earbuds because the sound quality is so much superior, even if they do fall out of my ears every 2 minutes.I was misled by the incredibly positive reviews on the apple website, and want to stress that if you are an avid music lover and your priority in an earphone is superior sound, these are NOT the earphones for you - particularly at this steep a price.Another issue - just as I had to constantly readjust the standard ipod earbud and push it back into my ear, I too have to constantly readjust the back of the earpiece to keep it tightly fitted so it doesn't hang loose and fall off (right ear's ok, but the left one apparently isn't B&O; compatible).Wish I had a better earphone to suggest, but I'm back at square one.  I would not, however, recommend this one to any of you on the market for a new pair.
B000BLALEI	THE BEST EARPHONES I HAVE EVER HAD COMPACT DURABLE THE SOUND IS JUST AMAZING ,,,,,,,,,,SUPER,,,,,,,
B000BLALEI	The B&O; headphones are extraordinary in many respects. The sound is excellent - not as bass-heavy as Bose are, but a lot cleaner in sound, which is actually more "honest" and true to the actual sound of instruments and voices. If you put them on correctly the low frequency end is very good, and the mid and high ranges are excellent anyways. I listen mainly to classical music, the sound quality for that is overall excellent. On iPods the benefit of these headphones is a significantly higher volume than for example with the standard Apple headphones. Normally it is very difficult to hear classical music with an iPod due to the low volume, but with these headphones this is no issue.I have read complaints about putting these headphones on - I had no such problems. You have to think for a second which goes on which ear, then lift the piece that goes behind the ears, place the centre-piece above the opening of your ear and then simply push it all back together again. The aluminum is excellent in terms of design and durability. Don't pull on the cables too much, they look a little fragile.These are, in summary, extraordinary headphones. They are not the kind to be thrown into a backpack or stuffed into a pocket, these should be treated with care and sensitivity. The design is outstanding and the sound quality very clean and open, not artificially enhanced in any specific area of the spectrum.
B000BLALEI	I am crazy about the design of this product, which is totally user-oriented. Besides, the sound quality is satisfying. I really enjoy it.
B000N8P4R8	The Audio transport controls do not work with my Nokia N73 music edition phone. Disappointing since this is an advance music focused phone. This could be a problem with other NSeries phones. The audio quality while OK for calls, leaves a lot to be desired for music listening. It gets really bad if the phone has more than one active bluetooth connections. The nokia radio player doesn't work with a bluetooth headset either.
B000N8P4R8	I use this on a Palm Centro. While the high quality setting (on my Softick Audio Gateway (SAG) software) takes significant memory, I've been able to listen to music on PTunes, buffer it to the headset via bluetooth, control the music player using AVRCP AND at the same time read a book on Mobipocket.Headset cabling is a teensy bit awkward but it's quite easy to clip the pendant on a pants pocket and have just the right length to reach the ears without jerks. The extremely low weight and compactness of the pendant make it barely noticeable.Buttons are slick and responsive, audio skipping is rare and completely absent if I'm not multi-tasking on my Centro. Bluetooth range is impressive (no lag/skips across a medium sized room).Pendant has a mini-usb port for charging but it doesn't come with a usb charger cable (it does have a normal wall outlet adapter for charging). Battery life is excellent. I have to charge once every three (might go more) days if I use it continuously for about an hour or two every day.The phone call quality is nice too. The person I was talking to could hear everything fine and vice versa.You WILL have to blow an additional $20 on software (SAG) to use this (or any stereo bluetooth headset with remote control) with the Palm Centro for listening to music. Other phones, PDAs might have different requirements (some are directly compatible - be sure to check in advance).
B000N8P4R8	the sound is great and i can listen to music for hours. My only issue is the akward length and the difficulty of putting the longer earbud wire behind my head. It wont stay.
B000N8P4R8	My husband really wanted it and he got it.  Plays with the dam thing all the time on his verizon cell phone.  Good Gift at a decent price.
B000N8P4R8	After charging the unit I couldn't get it to turn on. I contacted Plantronics' tech support and they replied really quickly, within hours (kudos for that). They wanted me to send my unit back to them and they'd send a new one, but I had to pay for shipping both ways. After searching their forums it sounds like the problem might be that the unit is so old it can't hold a charge (mine is dated February 2007). I don't want to take a chance that I'll get another old one (or a refurbished one as one user on their forums suggested) so I'm not bothering to send it to them; I'm just asking for a refund from Amazon. It's a shame. I was really excited about this headset (I liked the idea of a lanyard instead of having to clip it to something).On the plus side, the unit is very lightweight, the controls are a good size and feel easy to learn and use, it comes with different sizes of ear plug thingys and it even comes with an audio-out cable to hook it up to speakers or a stereo. Also, the image doesn't show it, but there's a small slide-able clip between the plug and the call control button so you can clip the cord somewhere if it's weighing down the ear plugs, and the length of the cords going to your ears are different; one is much longer to go around the back of your neck.
B000N8P4R8	The transmitter feels a teensy cheap and the included earbuds are pretty annoying to get on, but the sound quality is way better than I expected. If you're an audiophile like me and you've wanted to try bluetooth buds, these would be a decent place to go for the money.
B000N8P4R8	Listening to music great sound quality but when you switch into phone mode the audio quality is cut in half. If you are getting this product for gaming your audio quality will be lacking.
B000N8P4R8	This is a neat toy. It sounds good, and people cant tell im on a headset when I use this with my iphone. It will also connect to an Ipad2, and stream music. Reception is actually pretty great, i can walk at least 20 feet away before the signal cuts out in a cubicle environment. Connection seems to be a slight issue with the ipad, in terms of it staying connected, but this may have been to poor battery, or other interference. The buttons work with pandora, but the mute / pause button is finicky, and also seems to cause it to disconnect sometimes. Another downside is the audio jack is the smaller, 2.5 mm, so, standard anything wont work without the 6$ adapter from radio shack :PThe item is light in weight, which is a plus. headphones are decent. pairs easy enough. device does NOT connect to multiple devices at once (thought I read that somewhere, so I was disappointed when this did not work). Using headphones this thing provides nice, loud sound. however, when i use external speakers, the sound is not quite up to par, even with the ipad and the device turned all the way up. I have not tried it on my car or home stereo, but im not expecting much, which is also another disappointment.All in all, for $35, it does what it says, has good range, and good quality of audio when using the supplied headset.
B000N8P4R8	I have used this Stereo Bluetooth Pendant with two phones... Palm's Treo 750 and Motorola's Rizr Z3. The sound from both is great, and you can use it as a handsfree device at the same time. I think all bluetooth phones can handle the handsfree profile but not the Bluetooth Stereo profile. Make sure your phone can handle the A2DP profile.Also used it with my bluetooth enabled laptop, an HP Pavilion dv9000. Like with my phones, sound quality is really good. The handsfree or headset profile can be used to make Skype, Yahoo, and Windows Messenger' calls, all with great clarity.It can control audio playback and volume settings. Play, Next, Previous, Pause, Volume up, Volume Down.
B000N8P4R8	This was my 1st Bluetooth purchase but it might as well be my previous corded headset because the cords are still all over the place--hanging off me, getting entangled with everything, falling from around my neck & easily pulled from my ear. It looks sloppy wearing it, with the cords being different lengths & all. I needed stereo so I can listen to music on my cell when I commute. But when calls come in I'd rather just take the call when my hands are free so I can hold the phone. At times, people on the other end tell me to speak up. However, it is not ALL bad. The stereo sound is great when plugged into the phone jack itself. (Bad when listening to the music via the Bluetooth device.) Overall, I think the concept is cool, I just think it would've made more sense to design this as a regular in-ear Bluetooth device with the option to connect a second earpiece for stereo. That's actually what I was hoping to find before I purchased this item, but didn't find it.
B000N8P4R8	These are about the best Bluetooth headphones I've found for my usage needs.They've lasted about 12-16 months before the battery wanes on its charging capacity.  I use them about 4 times a week for 1-2 hours a day (bike commuting and for workouts).1) I've attached a lanyard to main piece and hang them from my neck. I like that  I don't have to attach my phone to my arm or some other nearby location to be able to use the headset like I would have to do with wired earphones.2) The TALK button on the earphone wire is easily accessed for incoming calls and call quality/sound seems to be pretty clear.3) The 2.5mm plugin makes this versatile, since you can plug this into a portable speaker or other device with a '2.5mm to 3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable' or adaptor.4) I give it 4 stars because the headphones provided could be a bit better designed.Using  a short 2.5mm male to 3.5mm female adaptor, you could use any headset, but would need to ensure the upgraded earphones had an inline mic if you wanted to answer calls.  I do like the fact that these do not wrap around the back of head like some bluetooth headsets and this makes it much easier for wearing a bike helmet, etc.
B000N8P4R8	Nice stereo sound, excellent call quality (a little hollow/tinny but not bad overall).Some reviewer gave a rating of 1 for this and commented on the different lengths of the cord! - the pen clip on the volume control tag is supposed to go on the shirt packet (to one side) and so the other side ear needs a longer cord! It is done correctly with a purpose (just that everybody may not put on the shirt pocket and may hang on the neck using a lanyard - then it doesn't make sense to have different lengths).Overall, nice fitting on the ears, decent sound isolation for the money.IPHONE USERS: Beware - iphone still doesn't support A2DP profile, so the stereo mode (ipod/songs) wont play on this - only the phone will work on this.
B000N8P4R8	While working around the house, I use this headset to listen to audio streaming from my laptop. It works fine so long as the Pulsar 260 Bluetooth Pendant (the part with the detachable clip) is in DIRECT line of sight with the IOGEAR Bluetooth 2.1 USB Micro Adapter (the part that connects the Pulsar 260 headset to my laptop). In short, I experience two issues with this headset:1) Soon as I turn around which 'blocks' the DIRECT line of sight between the Pulsar 260 Bluetooth Pendant & the laptop, I start hearing lots of noise/interference.2) I'm unable to use this headset while I making phone call via my laptop's Skype. There may possibly be compatibility issue which is over my head.I'd enjoy this headset more if the above issues are resolved.
B000N8P4R8	The bluetooth works fine, the stereo sound is good, and the silicone earbuds are comfortable and secure.  I don't know how noise-isolating they are, but they feel good and they do block noise at least compared to regular earbuds.However.  The earbud cord is made of a stiff, plasticky material rather than a more flexible substance.  It is absurdly long, and cords from the individual earbuds to the main cord are of different lengths for some unfathomable reason.  Altogether, this results in a mess of cord hanging from your ears and flapping around your waist.  There is a clip to clip the cord to your shirt, but if you use that, then the earbuds pull every time you turn your head, unless you leave enough cord free above the clip, which is annoying and looks dumb.  If you don't use the lanyard, you must use the clip on the pendant or else it will pull the earbuds out of your ears.  If you clip the pendant to your belt and you want to take the earbuds out, they will hang around your ankles.  But if you use the lanyard to hang the pendant around your neck, the situation is even worse because the lanyard adds another foot or two of cord -- truly, the cord length is ridiculous.  The lanyard is also made of a thick, plasticky material that retains the crimps caused by the manner in which it is packaged.  And if you do use the lanyard and you want to remove the earbuds and let them hang, then they hang around your shins (higher than if you don't use the lanyard and clip the pendant to your belt, but still ridiculous).  If you don't use the lanyard, then you must clip the pendant to your clothing and deal with the stiff earbud cords flapping around.  It looks messy and unprofessional and the cords get in the way.The microphone is located on one of the earbud cords, and it hangs too low - nearer my chest than my mouth.  People on the other end of phone calls complained of the sound quality even when I held the microphone near my mouth.Finally, every time you push a button, there is a loud beep in the earphones.  So, if you want to increase the volume by hitting the volume up button a couple of times, you get a loud beep each time you push it, which also interrupts the music.All in all, I wanted to like this, but had to return it.  I don't recommend it.  There are better solutions out there.  I opted for the LG HBS-110.  The design of that one is very good, but I wish it had silicone earbuds like the Plantronics.
B000N8P4R8	I'm fairly new to the world of bluetooth devices and never has it been so difficult to find exactly what I want. After endlessly dealing with conventional earbuds dying on me, I was seeking to find something that was just as comfortable (for me) with the additional feature of being (slightly) wireless.The Pros: it is wireless, I found recently that I can connect several devices at the same time (my phone and iPod as long as they both don't try to use the audio at the same time), and it's small and convenient. The Cons: (and not all Panasonics fault) cannot control my iPod, the cable lengths are different as to cause you to wrap the left bud around your head (I don't want to wrap it around my head, I want wear it like I use to wear any other earbuds), battery life only 8 hours (matches most of the devices I'm using them for, but sucks when you're walking home at the end of the day and the thing is dying with beeps and pauses), and the pluggin is a microjack that you can't plug into any device (again mostly at the end of the day when the transmitter is dead) which sadly makes me carry a backup pair of the very earbuds they were to replace.I don't make earbuds, but I know what I like. I like the conventional earbuds, and wish that some one would just make that design into a wireless device that has a decent battery life, or is more capable with other chargers so I can have a separate phone charger at work (without having to buy a specific charger just for this device). The iPod stock earbuds are close (except not being bluetooth) cause I want to control both a phone and audio device. I get hours of enjoyment and that is good, but these are not great.
B000N8P4R8	I expect a 3.5 mm audio jack and the pendant is little bigger than expected. It works with my thinkpad T61, and my cell phone. with the laptop the sound quality is not good. but with mobile quality is excellent.
B000N8P4R8	Bought mine in Japan for an outrageous price and after about 10 months, one ear-piece died. Thinking it was the earbuds, I replaced their (special)ones and found the problem to be the dongle. Customer support was friendly but, completely unhelpful as it was past warranty. I would have paid for repairs, but they don't repair, only replace. So now all i have is a mono-wireless-speaker adapater
B000N8P4R8	Pros: easy to use, long battery life, can be charged using USB port, light weight, clear sound, reasonably priced, no interference even in busy city environmentCons: mediocre sound quality, cords are too long, 2.5mm connector instead of 3.5mm on most headphones.Had it for about a month.  Overall this unit works well.  Easily paired with my iPod touch and Sony phone.  Sound quality for voice conversation is great.  Although I'm not a heavy cell phone user, I haven't had to recharge the battery in the past month.  Bluetooth signal is very stable within as far as approx 20ft (indoor).  No unpleasant background noise was heard.  Stereo sound quality is somewhat dissapointing.  The earbuds are made with cheap plastic.  No left or right, except one of them is on the longer side of a "Y" cable.  Frequency response range seems to be narrow in the middle, i.e. highs and lows are lost.  Thought I could replace the headset using my Sony headphone.  But I knew I was wrong right after I received it.  The connection is a 2.5mm plug, not 3.5mm standard for headphones.  Plantronics does provide an adapter cable to convert 2.5mm to 3.5mm, but it adds at least another 3' to the already-too-long cable.  What makes it worse is that the volume control is completely lost when Sony headphone is connected using the adapter cable.  Music volume is pushed to the highest, which makes it unusable.  So I had to switch back to the default headset.  The price is reasonable, that's why I'm keeping it, as I need a bluetooth set for voice calls, and occasional music when I don't have my Sony/iPod with me.
B002N8JAY4	Bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them and they worked well for him when he was biking or traveling and wanted to talk on the phone.  No complaints
B002N8JAY4	Love it! Works well and durable! Thanks so much. I use them when I work out and they were a great price too
B002N8JAY4	The product was made well, was shipped great and arrived on time. Only thing is the jack to plug into my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone was too small. I guess I thought all of those jacks were standard size but that's not the case. Otherwise, I would recommend the seller- as everything came quickly and securely.
B002N8JAY4	Arrived a trifle later than promised and has no instructions whatsoever.I have it in my car for the occasional long journey when I might just receive a call.
B002N8JAY4	fits Samsung Convoy phone with 2.5mm jack, sounds good when listening to music.  fits in my ear nicely and is comfortable to wear. no battery to keep recharging lie with a Bluetooth headset
B004VUEO3O	I rate this as the best thing I have ever purchased for my iPhone. I do a lot of phone conferencing and making it easy to hear and easier to be heard while I adjust graphics to the clients wishes is now far easier. Previously, I was crushing the iPhone against my ear so that at the end of a teleconferencing session my ear really hurt. This has been so much better. Their design is noise canceling by nature and the microphone works well in high noise situations. I had a little discomfort at the beginning getting used to the tightness BUT I soon grew accustomed to it and it was far better than crushing the iPhone against my head.
B004VUEO3O	They are very good quality headphones, but not all that comfortable.  Although they are adjustable, they lay on the ear rather than around it.
B004VUEO3O	I wanted something with a volume control on the wire with good sound quality and this did the job for me
B004VUEO3O	It is comfortable to wear and the sound is good.  Works well with my iphone. I would prefer it if the ear pieces were large enough to go completely around my ears but they are cushioned and comfortable.
B004VUEO3O	I'll tell you this right off the bat... I'm no audiophile.  I'm an everyday average consumer.  I will also tell you this... I have owned numerous pairs of headphones or ear buds from Bose to Skull Candy to Beats to Sony to Sennheiser to Audio Technica... And for the price, none of them beat the sound, build, comfort, and style of these headphones. Sure, some of them may slightly edge out these in certain individual areas. However, most people, I believe, are looking for a complete and well rounded package. These UrbanEars head phones provide that. They sound great, delivering well rounded sound. They are comfortable enough for extended wear and block out most noise (even jet engines). They look great and come in a variety of colors (try B and H Photo online or urbanears.com for more colors) and the in-line volume control and mic are great for all smart phone users that use a 3.5mm jack. I use them with my MacBook Pro, IPad 2, and iPhone 4 all the time. One final feature that makes them great is the built in audio jack they call the ZoundPlug. It allows you to share the audio with someone by plugging their headphones into the audio jack discretely hidden in the ear piece. And you get no noticeable degradation in sound quality. It's a great bonus to these headphones. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for great sound quality and a complete package at a great price!
B004VUEO3O	Very cool, good looking, no big logos or anything so they're also subtle. Sound is excellent right out of the box. I really enjoyed, as others have commented on, the fact that you can plug in another set of headphones, which came in extremely handy during a recent trip. Fold down and are very portable as well. Love them!
B004VUEO3O	Really like the cool look and quality of these earphones. Plus, love using it with my iPhone as a hands-free device. My only complaint would be if you're wearing them for long periods of time, they start to make your ears sore.
B004VUEO3O	To me these are the perfect headphones for any apple device. The built-in volume control and microphone make it easy to adjust the volume and advance (or retreat) to the desired song on your iPad, iPod or iPhone. They are relatively inexpensive and the sound quality is acceptable.
B004VUEO3O	After reading such stellar reviews about these headphones, I thought I'd buy them, especially since I got a really great deal. These headphones are not worth $60, and they're barely worth the $28 I paid for them. Although they look great and feel like they're well built, the sound is thin and, honestly, they don't sound any better than iPod headphones. A while back, I had Panasonic headphones that were cheaper, and although they weren't as good looking, they sounded awesome.[...]Check them out if you're looking for a budget pair of headphones that sound good. If you want a sexy pair that have a mic and volume control, but inferior sound, go with the Urbanears.
B004VUEO3O	As good as promised, excellent range, good fit and fashionable. The choice of colors were superb. Purchased for my iPad and is a perfect match. I highly recommend these headphones.
