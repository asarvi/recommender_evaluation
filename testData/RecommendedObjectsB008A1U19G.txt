B00065315U	I got this screen protector to protect my brand new camera I got for Christmas. It was super easy to put on, doesn't bubble at all! It can actually be removed, cleaned and put back on. Its a great product!
B00065315U	I will never buy this brand of LCD Coolpix S570 screen protector again, as they are not a quality product. They come with no instructions, no small cardboard squeege as others do, and a coarse rag to wipe your screen with. I have purchased other brands before and they worked perfectly. This is an inferior product, and I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00452TCCQ	This is not a bad product.The protector fits nicely on the face of the phone and sticks very well and without air bubbles.It also doesn't take away from the screen.  When clean, you'd swear there's nothing there but......it's never clean.  This thing is a fingerprint magnet that you'll be cleaning constantly.  And often when your hands are clean it will feel a bit sticky making it hard to slide your fingers.So it's ok, especially for the price.  But I'm sure there must be a better product out there.
B00452TCCQ	Would have given it 5 stars had it not been such a hassle to put on.  However, if you manage to put it on correctly, you forget your phone has it on.  That speaks volumes for its quality.
B00452TCCQ	Works as advertised but 2 screens for the price just makes no sense. These guys must be the biggest rip-offs in town. 2 transparent plastic screens for what they charge?????
B00452TCCQ	both screen protectors came with a crease/dent/fold. must have happened before packaging, because the package was heavy duty cardboard, and there was no marks on the package. so they sent damaged goods.
B00452TCCQ	It's easy to apply and looks good on my device. A few weeks after the first one was placed on, I noticed a hole. It seemed like there was a fine bubble that maybe didn't get pressed out all the way that I never noticed. I put the second one on a few months ago. Viola.
B00452TCCQ	These performed about as I expected. They were fairly tricky to install. Lots of bubbles. The back side of the screen guard is just tacky enough to pick up every speck of dust in the area.I gave up on and bought a ZAGG instead. These are OK, but the ZAGG is definitely a superior product.Zagg invisibleSHIELD for Samsung Fascinate Galaxy S (Screen)
B00452TCCQ	Screen protector is cut to fit perfectly on the phone. Very easy application without bubbles. Protector fits well under snap on case. Film feels a little bit "tacky" when you slide your finger over it.
B004Y0QJOS	These screen protectors are very soft and will scuff quite easily. Don't lose the cleaning cloth because in less than 2 weeks, I'm already on screen protector #2 from the package. They smudge easily and make using your phone in the bright sunlight difficult.On the bright side...I can see my ugly face every time I pick up my phone to play Words With Friends.Spare Products Screen Protector Film for iPhone 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Mirror
B004Y0QJOS	Bought this for my new iPhone 4 and it was a great buy!  I got 2 screen protectors for less than #10 and after several months of use, still enjoying the first one.  Very happy with this purchase!
B005R5M3RQ	It goes on easy, great surface protection, is precisely cut, and was shipped quickly.  However, while it may not prove a big deal, there is no cutout for the camera.  The little baggies that hold the screen protectors, all three of them, do, in fact have the hole cutout...the protectors themselves do not...weird.
B006YHDLY0	I really like your product well made easy to install no bubbles cleans easy plenty of insttructions supply tools to clean and apply  and well packed  and a supposed lifetime warranty  great job
B006YHDLY0	I have tried other screen protectors and have never had one like this.  Everthing you need to put it on is there and the instruction where easy to follow.  After I put it on and waited for the specifity time.  My screen is clear and well protected.  Great product and the right people to by it from.
B006YHDLY0	Great product. I purchased one two years ago and it is still looking good and doing its job. I recently got a phone for my son so I bought one for that phone too.It did take way too long to get here.
B006YHDLY0	Love this thing. When I felt how thick it was I thought it would make it very difficult to use the phone. I was wrong. In fact, when I first got this phone (coming from a blackberry) the touchscreen was too sensitive. This actually made it easier to use. I'm horrible to my phones and I know this has paid for itself 30 times over already. I can tell by the feel it was designed for hard core phone abusers like me.
B006YHDLY0	Screen protector feels durable and cleans easily.  Was obviously much thicker than the cheap ones you can get here on Amazon.  Came with a great kit for cleaning the phone and applying the protector.  Also, I love the custom holes for the speaker and front camera that are cut for my phone as well as the fact that it covers the entire front including the touch sensitive menu, home, and search keys.  The only case I could find for my phone was the body glove, which did not provide as much protection as I would have liked (admittedly I tend to be rough with my gadgets) but with this full screen cover I don't have to worry as much about damage.
B006YHDLY0	Do not buy! Waste of $$$. Do not buy. Do not buy. Waste of money. So expensive and all you get is one clear shield.
B006YHDLY0	This looked great when I first installed but as time went on and it dried it got bumpy. It was probably user error with the install but I read all the instructions and folloed the directions on the video. It is ok just not a crystal clear finish.
B006YHDLY0	So, I bought 3 of these screen protectors. Two for the Nokia, and one for a samsung phone (one for me, one for my wife, and one for another family member). I was given the task of installing these on the phones, and since I did 3, I got some good practice, and learned some important lessons.Here's what you should know:1. Their "lint-free" cloth they provide isn't completely lint free. It left a little black thread link on my screen that ended up getting encased under the screen cover. It wouldn't be a huge deal, but it's right in the middle of my screen, so my eye is always drawn to it. It's not big, and it doesn't compromise the integrity of the cover, but it's distracting, and frustrating that the cloth that was supposed to get rid of that stuff actually caused it... that was phone number 1. Lesson learned. Don't trust the cloth alone to get rid of all lint... check check check check check, and then check again, to make sure there's no lint on your screen when you are going to put your protector on.2. Don't use the squeegee they provide. It's just a little cutout of thin plastic that you're supposed to use to push the liquid out, but the one's i received did not have smooth edges. They had rough edges that WILL scratch the screen protector. I didn't use mine on phone #1, but on my wife's phone, I used the squeegee, after trying to smooth out the rough plastic, and afterwards, I noticed tiny little scratches all over the protector where I had used the squeegee. Don't use it! Just push the liquid out with the cloth, or use something else hard and flat that you know won't scratch it. That was phone number 2. Another lesson learned.3. Now it was time to install the protector on another family member's phone, and I used my previous lessons to install hers. That one turned out almost perfect. Third time is the charm I guess!Overall, the product itself, the screen protector, is a good product. The installation accessories they provide, though, can actually cause problems or damage your protector. Since you only get one, it's not like you can just redo it after you install it, which is why I hope this post helps anyone interested in this product. I'm not saying don't buy it... I'm just saying to use my lessons to help you avoid having the same issues.
B006YHDLY0	Its a little difficult to install. You have to wait 12-24 hours to use your phone. Bubbles seemed to fade during this time though.
B006YHDLY0	Once the TechSkin, is installed it works great.  The installation is a little tricky, but there are great instructions on YouTube and included with the product.  Once installed there were a lot of micro-bubbles between the skin and the phone screen, but I left it over night and by morning the bubbles were gone and the phone was ready for use.  Hint: I installed the skin in the bathroom after running the shower for a while.  The hope was that it would get the dust out of the air and from the results, it worked.  Also, use a lot of the provided spray on your fingers to make sure you don't get fingerprints on the skin.  As you can tell, I liked the product and would buy again.
B006YHDLY0	This offers a clear view of the screen and seems like it will be very protective.  It is a little more complicated to apply than I had anticipated, so it took me longer to actually attempt to use it, but it wasn't too difficult.
B006YHDLY0	I had to send this back because of the phone that I bought it for.  The phone was too small and so there was no need to keep the screen protector.
B006YHDLY0	I found this protector to be absolutely perfect. I had purchased another brand that came with two protectors and I damaged both trying to install them. This one went on very easily the first try and you can't even tell the difference between it and the screen prior to installing it. It's very clear, smooth, and easy to slide your finger across for using the touch screen feature. It left no bubbles, scratches, or dings.
B006YHDLY0	Very nice product. Some come out a bit fuzzy, but this one did nothing to prevent the nice HD pictures come through. My husband put it on in a steamy bathroom to cut down on dust. No bubbles or particles that way.
B006YHDLY0	I've installed plenty of these protectors before. The installation procedure went smoothly, but the end result was that the protector made the screen cloudy, and it was covered in scratches after less than an hour in a pocket. Awful product. Ignore the cheap price from Skinomi and just buy the real deal from one of the other companies--it'll save you a lot of time and money in the long run.
B006YHDLY0	I followed the instructions precisely in installing a Skinomi on my new Samsung Galaxy Blaze. A week after installing, I got an email from Skinomi suggesting I watch the installation video before reviewing. I watched it and didn't find anything that I had not found in the written instructions, except the suggestion to clean off the work surface with Windex or something before installing. I didn't do that, but the work surface was clean and I didn't get any hairs or dust onto the screen.  The installation went as described. The detergent solution is very effective in initially cleaning the surface, and in temporarily rendering the adhesive friction-free for easy placement. I made an error of perhaps a millimeter in aligning the bottom portion of the screen protector, but as the cover I bought wraps slightly around the front, this was no problem. (It is probably unlikely that you are going to get a picture perfect installation on your first try, but if you are careful it will be satisfactory.)My reason for only giving the product a 3 (I would give it 3.5 if that were available), is that the final result is not a glass-like surface. Ridges are visible running vertically along the whole length under certain light conditions. Possibly this was due to an imperfectly smooth credit card, the edge of which I used for smoothing--but I don't think so. Having read other reviews I took considerable care to find the smoothest unused card I had. I believe it is simply the nature of the product. Another imperfection is that you see moir&eacute; patterns if there is significant grease, such as from eating a sandwich, on the screen. This can occur with glass too, but the extra thickness of the screen allows for greater refraction of the light.All in all, I am happier having the protector than not. It is better than the cheap one I used in the waiting period before this one arrived in the mail. It is just not so "ultra clear" as you might expect from the advertising. It is functional, and you can see through it without much distortion. But you know it's there. If I knew a better alternative I would use that. But I don't.
B006YHDLY0	Its ok. Nothing to brag about, nothing to rave about. I could not get ALL the bubbles out of it.
B006YHDLY0	I've bought way cheaper screen protectors than this, but never a better value than this one . What you get is a professional install kit.
B006YHDLY0	Did not wear well over time, did not like that it marked up to easy and then looked funny.  Tried a few times but was not satisfied.  Went to another product, so far so good.
B006YHDLY0	I don't know what people are complaining about.  If you follow the directions, the protector will go on smoothly. I DID get a small tiny spec in it, but it was super easy to fix. And there are some great how to videos on YouTube.
B006YHDLY0	Price was good.  Installation was not bad.  But seemed to still have bubbles under the screen.  I just took it off.
