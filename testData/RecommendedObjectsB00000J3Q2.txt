B000RZCVX2	I have a leather holder but this one is so much better. Very sung and easy to access. love the thumb release.
B000RZCVX2	This is a much better belt clip than I had anticipated. The spring loaded clasp release is easy to use and holds the phone in firmly.  You put the phone in it face in or face out. The swivel belt clip makes it versatile to carry in an upright position or horizontal.
B000RZCVX2	A nice surprise: This clip works just like the Blackberry case, automatically putting your phone in "sleep mode" when it's used.  The clip is secure and strong, yet easy to disengage when the phone rings. Who could ask for more?
B000RZCVX2	I had one of these before, and used it hard.  The vertical click mechanism finally broke, and it would just spin limply.  This lasted longer than any other clip I had, so I got another one.  Be aware, there are versions for skinned and unskinned phones.  Be sure to get the right one.
B000RZCVX2	I bought this for it's minimal look with my "naked" Pearl, and because it feels sturdy and supports the BlackBerry sleeper function.  The design also makes it great for listening to music with headphones, as you can reach the volume rocker and the mute key to pause your music while holstered.
B00332GRUY	broke my original one just by sitting down in the chair. I did not know if I could find another one. but lucky found it online now I got two back up's
B00332GRUY	You can not go wrong with this product and the price. I recommend this product and the company for quick and honest business.
B00332GRUY	Very impressed by this simple design phone hip holder.  Stong even though on the thin side. Definitly worth your investment.
B00332GRUY	My phone is very old but you would think by now they would have come up with a better clip mine lasted a week this time . Breaks in the same place every time right where you push to release the phone.
B00332GRUY	Like it much better than the one I got from the Verizon store.  The fact that it faces out means you do not have to un-clip it to use it.
B00332GRUY	I received the Boulder holster within 2 days of ordering it! Perfect! It's exactly what I wanted and receiving it just before Christmas was a bonus! Thank you so much!
B00332GRUY	Great product and was just as described. Fits Boulder phone great. I use this for work only when I am on the water to keep from losing it.
B00332GRUY	I bought this holster to carry my Casio Boulder phone and only had it for a couple months when the top thumb release broke right off.  The holster is useless now and I am back to shopping for a new and better carry case.Don't waste your money on this one unless you plan on keeping the phone in the holster in your back pack or purse, if you use it on your belt your likely to break the thumb latch AND your phone when it hits the concrete!
B00332GRUY	Have tried a number of other phones and found each one lacking until I received this one - now I am satisfied and happy with how it performs.
B00332GRUY	This phone clip was a great replacement. Infact, the phone fits perfect, and the clip is really super sturdy plastic.
B00332GRUY	I received prompt and courteous service from the seller and I would rank the product itself 4 out of 5 stars.. The only drawback to the product is that when you need to use or answer your phone you must first take it out of the holster instead of just being able to flip it open....
B00332GRUY	The belt clip broke on the first day. I am in construction so I am hard on my equipment but I hoped it would last longer
B00332GRUY	Product came quickly and was exactly as advertised. I am very rough on the holster and it seems to hold up well so far. Can't beat price.
B005698CBO	I purchased the Ballistic phone case for my Samsung Infuse. It's just as good, if not better than an Otterbox Case. I love it. It is Awesome!
B005698CBO	We purchased this case as a gift for our 12 year old daughter who has a Samsung Infuse phone. She was terrified she might break the phone accidentally with the flimsy case we'd picked up locally because, after all, the phones are basically glass. While big, this case is great. It does add bulk but the phone is pretty large on its own.  The case is three pieces total. A holster (which she does not use), a rubber type sleeve and then a heavy duty plastic shield that fits around the rubber case.  The plastic shield is optional but she uses it. The built-in screen protector doesn't affect the touchscreen sensitivity at all. The corners are well protected and the buttons, while covered, are still easy to use.I have a Ballistic case for my Galaxy S2 and love it but no holster. Otherwise, I think Ballistic cases are terrific.
B005698CBO	WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT !!!! I bought this product for durability, I am a construction worker and this product is very durable to handle the abuse of working. If you want a slim sleek case this is not for you!!!! This is a MAN'S CASE!!! Easy access to the touch screen and a great holster. One Stop Cell Shop delivered as promised by the time I was told and half the price of retail stores. My first purchase from this store is 2 thumbs UP!!! I will return for any future products.
B005698CBO	This case had good solid concept but it fails in a couple of areas. First the screen protector is horrible especially on the Samsung Infuse which has an awesome screen. The screen protector give an almost unbearable experience by producing a grainy display making text hard to read even on the Infuse 4.5 inch screen. This case also comes with a rubber outer cover that mainly covers the corners and its function is to absorb impact. It also difficult for this product to stay affixed as it has little tabs that are suppose to fit inside the main case. I never use this outer cover becuase this case add substantial bulk. The main case which I believe most use is functional by giving access to all the phones buttons and ports. I have noticed that the bottom portion of this case by the charging port lacks clips so the case has a bowing effect which has affected the screen protector by lifting it from screen. My remedy was removing the screen protector (held by glue very easy to remove) which gave me two advantages a viewable screen and function of my bottom physical keys. The case use to fit and snap together tightly but are a couple of month of owning it and only removing a handful of times it has not stayed snapped together after a two foot fall. I has high hopes for this case but it has some design flaws that has made it fail. I believe this case should last the life of your phone which for most is every two years; not two months especially at the premium it sells for.
B005698CBO	It was a very nice case solid and big. I had problems with the case because when somebody called me they couldn't hear me. But I could hear the other person on the phone. Also my sister has the same phone and case she doesnt have any problems. I ended up getting me a different case for my phone. It work alot better.
B005698CBO	This does protect the phone very well.  I'm glad that I got it.2 things that need improving though (except for these, I would have given it 5 stars);1. Ballistic needs to figure out the problem with the rubber tabs coming out.  Not a big problem, just an annoyance.2. The belt clip needs a similar setup to the Otter, so you can prop the phone up to watch videos.Otherwise, very good!
B005698CBO	The ballistic HC case for the Samsung Infuse phone is very effective as a protective device.  I do like that it saves myphone from all of my clumsiness.  My only issue (which cannot be avoided) is the phone becomes this big, cumbersome object that I must tote around on my hip.  It is okay, but I have to take off the rubber portion of the cover to get it in my shirt pocket, as I wear a uniform at work and cannot carry the clip on my duty belt (it won't fit).  Otherwise, it is a good product.
B005698CBO	I love the case! My phone looks brandnew when i open the case! It also has protected my phone from a couple of falls! Would recommend this for anyone who wants to keep a great phone!
B006KH66VE	Not bad for the price of it. It's so easy to put my cell phone on it and what's nice about is that, it swivels on any directions you're comfortable with.
B006KH66VE	This holster clip for the Sanyo Taho E4100 is what I needed. The phone fits in the holster clip, however it is a bit lose.
B006KH66VE	Excellent phone holder, much better quality than the OEM equipment I purchased with the phone at a lot cheaper price.  Holds the phone securely without any worries. Would definitely recommend if you have a Tahoe phone.
B006KH66VE	Have had it for a few days now, it works great! Forgot it was hooked on my jeans while I ran around playing basketball..didn't fall off once! Connects & maneuvers around smoothly.. glad I got it!
B006KH66VE	The Sanyo Taho holsters work pretty well.  I have had a lot of the holsters break, but it is from people sitting on them or smashing them with carts or swapping the holster between multiple people a few times a day 7 days a week and snapping off where they clip on at the top.  Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with them, although if they were unbreakable that would be nice :-)
B006KH66VE	The holster is the exact same item I could have purchased from the sprint store for over twice the price.  Works great!
