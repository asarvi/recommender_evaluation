B001B574XY	Car charger works as it should; the other data cable just confuses me.  Might be because I don't have the right software to connect it to my computer, but I never even use it.  Just got a mini SD card and adapter instead.
B001B574XY	The charger and cable are fine. Not sure what the disk is for. I can't use in in my computer since its a 3 inch CD.
B001B574XY	phone charger works great, but the driver disk for the sync cable is made for Motorola type phones and not for LG phones.
B001B574XY	This is just as good as any thing that the Cell Phone stores cell at ten times the cost.
B001B574XY	Charger works fine.  The only problem is that it gets really snugged and could cause damage.  USB cable works great if you can find any use for it and the driver upgrade.  CD is COMPLETELY USELESS!  The real negative part of this purchase is the CD.  Don't bother, it works for another phone.  Yes, not for the LG Decoy.
B001B574XY	This has worked very well for over a year now. Excellent product for an excellent price.
B001B574XY	I bought these for use with my (Verizon) LG env2 (VX9100) phone and both the car charger and USB cable work perfectly. While the charger feels less substantial than the Verizon-branded offering it is sturdy enough, particularly when you consider that it costs only 20-25% what the name brand does. I cannot comment on the CD as I did not use it, letting Vista choose the necessary drivers.
B001B574XY	Sorry, cell phone companies, but I don't feel privileged to buy accessories from your stores or websites when the items cost twice or thrice their value. This car charger for my new cell phone works perfectly, looks nicer and is so much more satisfying to buy at the low Amazon price than the overpriced version from the service provider.******UPDATE******Last week my car's radio circuit fuse blew. No radio, no accessories powered by either of my two accessory ports. After experimenting - and killing 5 fuses - turns out THIS item was the culprit. It fried internally somehow; maybe the tip touched just the right piece of metal or the heat in the car finally cooked it - who knows. What I do know is that I still wouldn't pay the inflated price for one of these at a cell company. But I also won't buy this brand again, either. I expect to receive more than 5-1/2 months service from an electronic accessory.
B001B574XY	I guess this was worth the cost of the car charger.. but the USB cable and software doesn't work..A gamble to buy this...
B001B574XY	The data cable for my phone didn't work for my EnV2. I had to order a different one which worked great.I guess I just got a bad cable. Cost more to ship it back to bother.
B001B574XY	The data cable is a nice quality cable that works great, the car charger on the other hand is cheap, it works, but very cheaply made, it doesnt strech out very good, kind of stiff. When unplugging from the cigarette light plug in my car, it sounds like the charger breaks. I would suggest spending a little bit more on a quality charger, maybe a Verizon brand whick my mother has, it is a very nice charger.Over all I give the data cable 10 out of 10, the car charger I give a 4 out of 10
B001B574XY	Yeah, I know they say so in the product description, but there is a disc in the picture, and most reviews mention a driver, so I was kind of expecting one. After digging around online for a while, I gave up on the driver concept. I got an excellent deal on two chargers for my LG EnV2 -- one for the car, one for the office and they work just fine.But then I discovered  [...] after I clicked on the "View Guide" link in Verizon's email newsletter. This will get you the right drivers if you use Verizon. Now I can use the USB charger as a data cable -- yeah!
B001B574XY	I've got dozens of these car chargers that I've accumulated over the years, and I gotta say, none of them look a whole lot different or better than this one. Except for the connector at the phone end, of course. The mini disc has the drivers for your computer, so it will recognize your phone when you plug it in to add music. You'll need the USB cable for that job too - because of that nonstandard connector you probably don't have one like it laying around the house.
B001B574XY	Data cable doesn't seem to work with my lg env2. I get a "Battery Required" message on my phone when I plug it into my laptop via the data cable. I tried, and messed around with it (probably longer than I should have) but eventually gave up. Also the phone got extremely hot when it was connected.. The car charger seems to work though, so it wasn't a total loss.
B001B574XY	I purchased this so I could easily do things with my phone and was disappointed. The car charger was the only good that came out of this.
B001B574XY	Both of these items work perfectly for me, easy to use, the car charger is convenient to take along while in someone else's car, the data cable can be used with any computer to download to or from the phone.  Both items get a lot of use and I am glad I purchased both.
B001B574XY	Data cable is useless without software.  Car charger fits so tight in my car lighter that it pulled it out of the dashboard when trying to remove it.  Did more harm than good.
B001B574XY	good product for the moneyvery convenient i leave itat work in case i forget to charge by acgood buy
B001B574XY	Data cable is micro-USB on one end.  Will work for any micro-usb device, currently cells phones are using this.Car charger works just as well as the more expensive Verizon branded one.A great price for the combo.
B0046CNN5M	I like the compact size of the car charger, and the price was perfect. I brought the charger because of the retractable cord. I was disappointed that the cord does not retract, however I can live with that fact because the price was so reasonable.
B0046CNN5M	This charger is excellent and the price is great. I love the retractable cord. It stores inside the charger and you don't have that tangled mess if you store more than one charger in you glove compartment. Can't beat the price. very much recommended..
B0046CNN5M	The charger works wonderfully.  After about 6 uses though, the retractable feature failed to work.  The cord is now extended all the time.  But it is a good charger!!
B0046CNN5M	Works GREAT!!!  I ordered another one prior to this one and it didn't fit my phone......even thought it said it was for my phone.  Since it was only $1.89, I just reordered.
B0046CNN5M	This awas a quick and very easy purchase. The retractable cord is great.  It stays right in my car.  It is very convenient!!
B0046CNN5M	mom was hunting a charger,didn't want to pay 10 times this muxh.Works great.And  arrived on time.Quality and value.Ty.Im very happy with this charger and u saved my mom around $20.. Awesome!!
B0046CNN5M	I would never purchase this product again. It would not retract on first use. Retractable cord ended up breaking when I tried pulling the cord to retract it. Most retractable cords have some tension when you pull it to make it retract and the cord had no tension for retracting.
B0046CNN5M	Great product to keep in the car as a spare charger.  Small and compact which is great when there are other wires in the car.
B0046CNN5M	This is a good little car charger. Earlier I had purchased two, but one did not work. When plugged into the car the phone charging icon did not activate. As a result, it drained the phone battery faster than you can imagine. Hey, for a couple of bucks, win some, lose some. I simply ordered another one and it worked great. If you plug it in, and your phone is NOT turned on, the charging icon will come on. If the icon does not come on, it is NOT working. We keep a charger in each car, and both work well.
B0046CNN5M	This is a great charger. I love that the cord is retractable. I've had this for quite a while now and it still works fine.
B0046CNN5M	Very nice charger, it my 2nd buy. The 1st one I gave away.Its heavy duty and the retractable button is very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a car charger they can depend on. Good deal too!
B0046CNN5M	Retractable charger for Pantech Ease P2020 cell phoneThe product arrived in 4 days as promised.  I pulled the cord out but it never retracted.  I didn't return it because it is still can be used by wrapping the cord up.  It is a real piece of junk.
B0046CNN5M	I thought, for a few dollars this charger wouldn't last long.  But this little gizmo quickly became a favorite and keeps performing.Pros:  No annoying cord tangles in the car =  compactIndicator light lets you know it's workingSenses when battery is full, so it won't overheatCons: Haven't discovered any yet
B0046CNN5M	I read the reviews but didn't listen.  Pulled the cord out the first time and it didn't retract just like the other reviews said.  glad it wasn't expensive.
B0046CNN5M	very satisfied, works well, does what it is supposed to do and simple to use, simple to keep out of the way in the car.
B0046LNR5O	i was happy with how fast the charger arrived and loved the price.the only thing is the adapter has a hard time staying in the cigarette lighter in the car.it works but any kind of movement the charger comes out of the hole,,it does its purpose as long as it is not touched and we dont hit a bump..but for the price i can live with that small bit of inconvenience
B0046LNR5O	Inexpensive but does the job. I would recommend the purchase. You can never have enough of these things around for convenience.
B0046LNR5O	It works great with my phone and the price is great.  Definitely worth the purchase.  Much better deal then the 'official' accessories.  I just leave this in my car all the time so that it is there when I need it.
B0046LNR5O	I give it a 4 out of 5. It was a great price compared to stores, it got to me in a speedy time, the only bad thing is sometimes when its plugged in it has to be put a certain way to charge other than that its a life saver. Thankyou
B0046LNR5O	Very inexpensive but works great! I was hesitant at first about purchasing something so inexpensive but glad I bought it.
B0046LNR5O	charges pretty quickly and isn't bulky like some other chargers; it was a great price so now i have a charger in each vehicle
B0046LNR5O	I should have known it was too good to be true. It worked for a week or so then completely stopped working from there on out, frustrating. At least it didn't cost me $40 like in sprint stores I guess.
B0046LNR5O	Phone charger was a great buy! makes charging my phone easy! I am able to use in on several different phones!
B005021M00	Like this charger a lot. Works as described. My phone is older, and I did not want to spend a lot of money on a car charger.
B005021M00	This OEM charger is a necessary accessory for power hungry android phones. No more panic when the low battery signals on my phone. So whether I'm on a long trip or after a long day at work I can still use all of my phone's functions (calls, gps, gasbuddy, flashlight app, etc). I carry one in each car.
B005021M00	IT WORKS!!!  had spent 2 months with a charger that didn't work unless i held it in a specific spot...little tough when you're driving.  I've used this several times and it works great.
B005021M00	I bought this charger about 6 months ago and have used it continuously without any problems since. I was skeptical at first due to its price (and due to previous bad experiences with low-cost off-brand chargers), but it actually says &#34;LG&#34; on it, is rather heavy, and charges my phone at a decent speed. I'd highly, highly recommend this product.
B005021M00	It burned out after a month of use. I used it every day for my car.  I travel and needed a cord I could count on.  Not this one.
B0055MPEEU	I was brand new when I got it! Works very well with my phone and I love the blue light when you plug it in.
B0055MPEEU	New OEM product appeared to be 1st quality functioned exactly as required.  Pilot light not so bright as to be distracting.  A bit large in shape and configuration requiring more room for storage but facilitating easy insertion and removal.
B0055MPEEU	I got this charger and it worked well for a few months. Now it wont charge my phone. So its a quick fix but dont expect it to work long.
B0055MPEEU	good looking charger, works real well and reaches further than expected. overall i'll say it's worth the moneyyou'll pay.
B0055MPEEU	I bought this to accompany me  on my long drives to Oklahoma every weekend. This is the perfect accessory to my phone! It's never leaving the car!
B0055MPEEU	I have ordered this product after I tried a few chargers that broke quick...Its a great product, arrived fast. Very happy with it
B0055MPEEU	Bought this for our Droid x2's.  Since the battery runs low fast on these phones, this is a must.  May buy one for each car as the price was just right.
B0055MPEEU	Bought 2 of these over a year ago and have had no issues.  Both charge any compatible device without issue and have worked flawlessly.
B006K45GJ0	I think this charger has some time of shortage in it! when i plug my phone into it sometimes, it doesn't charge,i need to wiggle the cord a little bit or lay my phone down a certain way for it to charge, and not move it.....which is very annoying.  Seems like it's a shortage in it or something.not satisfied.
B006K45GJ0	Looks good, the only thing I noticed is a bit slow charging, maybe it's my phone I'm not completely sure but does the work
B006K45GJ0	I bought this for my spouse and he loves it and uses it daily.  He couldn't find his old one and so I got this replacement for him.
B006K45GJ0	Works great!!!!! Bargain for a price of less than $5.00. Recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap car charger.
B006K45GJ0	works good, mailer it came in looked like it had been caught in the system and been worked over pretty good but the chager was fine and does the job,
B006K45GJ0	I have it saved for when I go on road trips I just wanted an inexpensive one to put in my bag
B006K45GJ0	This is a very goog item. Love the price too. So much more expensive in the stores or at a phone service outlet.
B006K45GJ0	This product is as good as the factory model. The charger works great and I would recommend purchasing this car charger as it is inexpensive and works well. Seller ships products in timely manner.
B006K45GJ0	For days when I accidentally forgot to charge my phone at night.  I just plug in and I am good to go.
B006K45GJ0	I am still using this car charger so no complaints. It has worked every time I plugged it in. Good price, too!
B006K45GJ0	This product is good and very cheap. I have ordered this one urgently. After that I have ordered another one from Tom Tom, they provided one more holder to use it for smart phone as well with USB port.
B006K45GJ0	For the price, you can't beat it! Mine works perfectly! Thank you =) Will buy another when needed! Also makes a great gift!
B006K45GJ0	I was a little hesitant on this because the price, but it works just as good as the expensive ones
B006K45GJ0	What else do you say after that....a shame because it was cheap enough. Maybe I'll just wait and reorder sometime in the future
