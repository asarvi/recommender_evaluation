B000ILN1I4	A perfect replacement to my lost cell phone charger.  Works exactly as it should!
B000ILN1I4	My wife needed a second one and she felt that all it did was let her use the phone while pluged in and no charge was made.  I will need to get my hands on it and do my own Geek check to it.
B000ILN1I4	It shipped fast and worked like a charm! What more can I say? Um.. I like the light on it?? LOL!! Thanks amazon
B000ILN1I4	My phone charger was falling apart and I was very happy to find this one for a great deal.  It works great!
B000ILN1I4	This product did not work well. It only charged phone for like 5 minutes then it said it was fully charged. After a while my phone died and this product said my phone was charged all the way. Not a great cell phone charger.
B000ILN1I4	I was concerned that an aftermarket wouldn't work as well as the LG brand, but I have not noticed any difference.  I use it in my car (Matrix) that has a standard 120V outlet.  I wanted the plug end to be slim like the original so it would still fit in the car outlet.  The slim end also works on power strips without interfering with the adjacent outlet.
B000ILN1I4	As previous reviewers said, ruined my phone also! Broke the piece on my phone meant to charge, now have to replace phone too! Seriously trash!
B000ILN1I4	This was so cheap I got two.!! Now when my son loses one I know where he can charge his phone.
B000ILN1I4	Finally, a company who is not out to "rob" consumers. I purchased an adapter for my cell phone from Amazon and was willing to risk it being compatible  to my phone for the price. It not only fit my phone, but was $24.78 cheaper than the company I have my service with. I am a life time customer. Prices and products are very acceptable. Thanks Amazon..
B000ILN1I4	Phone does not indicate that charging is occurring while connected to unit.  Only indication of charging activity is via LED on body of component.  Charging does, in fact, occur, but you are left to your best guess as to when or if the phone is fully charged.
B000ILN1I4	The product arrived promptly (before the scheduled ETA).. I was not home at the time, my mother was and she proceeded to connect her phone in order to use it. She was unable to connect it. I, at the time, assumed the charger was not compatible and wrote a bad review for that reason. When I returned from work, I was able to connect the phone so I removed my bad review, but the very next day when she attempted to use her cell phone after leaving it to charge overnight, it hadn't charged. The charge indicator on the phone dropped to 0 bars after removing the cell phone from the charger. Possibility of the battery being defective?? It's a possibility.. BUT the original charger that came with the phone was capable of fully charging the phone before it became lost. So I believe it's safe to say it's not the battery, it's the charger. I will be taking the cell phone back to AT&T to determine whether it's the battery or the phone. BTW - The seller has offered to return my money. They are willing to help, but they should not be selling a product that doesn't work. Period.
B000ILN1I4	This is the exact cell phone charger for my LG1200 cell phone and it works perfectly! It was a great bargain as well.
B000ILN1I4	I bought one of these like a year ago for (I think) around $1. I see that now it's selling for 1 cent (can't get much cheaper than that). My understanding is it's a generic product, so the quality is suspect. I personally haven't had any issues with mine, but it only gets light use since I'm not a heavy cell phone user, and I'm careful about wrapping the cord up and putting it away when I'm done charging my phone. If it gets heavy usage and/or rough treatment, I don't imagine it would hold up well, but, considering the price, I would say you can't go wrong with it if you need to replace a lost or broken original from your phone's manufacturer.
B000ILN1I4	I received this product and found that it did not work.  After contacting the company, they shipped out a new product, no problem.  You can bet, if you have a problem with the product, it will be handled properly...
B000ILN1I4	Needed this to replace a broken one. This fit the bill. Fits perfectly on the first installation. I'd recommend this to any that need this type of plug in.
B000MIBLMG	Buying on Amazon is relatively new to me. Certain products would seem hard to qualify just by browsing the specifications and manufacturer's description. A cellphone case,I thought,should be bought at a brick and mortar store. The customer reviews may be planted by the corporation's public relations department. However,I've been proven wrong on all my skeptical buying prejudices with this excellent product. Quality of materials surprised me as well. I originally thought that it would attract dust and lint,which would protect phone but at expense of seeming counter to my reasoning in purchasing this specific brand. Well,to my surprise,again,it's not a dust magnet. It's not alien technology but i'm amazed at how the materials are so well built while being inexpensive. Ironically,the ones at Tmobile are cheap to the eyes and feel even cheaper when one fits their phone. I'm referring to my experience. Boxwave and Ballistic appear similar to me,but the customer reviews pushed my decision towards Boxwave..and the 30% off the a second purchase. It does exactly what manufacturer promises. Not many issues fitting onto my Tmobile Galaxy SII variant. One gripe: I had a few misconceptions. One being that cases improve signal strength. Another is that the Wifi signal degrades while holding phone with two hands. If my left hand is covering the part where the camera is I've noticed fluctuations. Product,otherwise,is good to great. My misconceptions shouldn't stop anyone else to buy from Boxwave. Ordered two. Took a chance. Have not regretted it. I only wish that it did improve signal strength.
B000MIBLMG	I cannot believe that Otterbox does not sell a case for TMobile Samsung Galaxy S2! I was afraid that BoxWave will not be as good as Otterbox, but it is AS Good and cheaper!I paid full price for my S2 seeing I wasn't qualified for upgrade when I needed a new phone. I read reviews after reviews on BoxWave, as I want to protect my $500 investment. I am so glad I got this case. It looks fantastic on my white S2 and even though my phone has been dropped by accident, no damage whatsover on my phone.I have had this case now for over 3 months, it still looks good as new.I will definitely buy from this manufacturer again, they sell good quality stuff!
B000MIBLMG	I just received my Boxwave GS2 cell phone cover.  It meets all my expectations.  It is sturdy, well made in that is doesn't feel cheap, and fits the galaxy T989 like a glove.  All holes lined up perfectly.  No problems with the operation of the phone.  Protection is great as there is thick rubber which cushions the phone if dropped.  I got the black and white and am going to order a different color today, as it comes in many colors.  I got it through Boxwave on amazon, but saw it on amazon by another merchant which was cheaper by $7.00.  I will order this same cover from the merchant which offers it cheaper.  I just love it!  Get it, you will love it too.
B000MIBLMG	this case protected well, on par with the defender case form otterbox, and since at the time i bought this otterbox didn't make a case for this phone this was a great find for the protection and the price.
B000MIBLMG	I have a Galaxy S II by T-Mobile. It does work, but seem to not fit as good as the Ballistic. At first I couldn't get the buttons to line up, but I have now and we will see how long that last. It seems a little cheaper in quality than the Ballistic, but not that much to tell much difference.I wish someone would make a true 360 protection with the built in screen protector.Pros:Does fit with some work.I like the different colors to pick from.Cons:Hard to line up buttons.Cost about $6.00 more than it should.
B002D3D2X4	Charger is inexpensive and works well.  It was shipped and received very quickly.  Go for it!
B002D3D2X4	These are a great price..took rather long to receive due to another product being sent, over all my products I have ordered have been excellent.
B002D3D2X4	i bought a used cell phone for my daughter and the charger that came with it was so jacked up so i came on here and purchased the charger, its the exact charger i needed and works perfect! arrived to my house just when the order said it would
B002D3D2X4	Charger worked exactly like it was supposed to. Looked exactly like the original one that came with my cell phone. Had bought another after market charger which didn't work at all. Had to get a refund. This charger does everything it was supposed to. It charged my phone.
B002D3D2X4	I received the wall ac charger. It worked for one week. It is currently broke.
B002D3D2X4	When I accidentally broke my charger, I thought I would just call the ATT store and get a replacement. Wrong, they no longer carry them in any of their stores because my phone is older.  It was actually the guy at the phone store that told me to go to Amazon! AND, the price was way below what I was expecting to pay, Yay!Hey, it also works great, just like the one that came with my phone originally, same brand too.
B002D3D2X4	I don't even remember buying this thing.  I have no idea if it works or not but I want this review crap out of my account and since I can't select to delete it I have to put junk out there for poor customers to read.  Step up, Amazon.
B002D3D2X4	After my last charger broke, I ordered this one, which charged my phone exactly once before it refused to charge it any more. I now have a dead phone.
B002D3D2X4	The charger fits well, and acts normal. Other than the Quickfire having strange touch screen issues, this was a solid purchase. Recommended!
B002D3D2X4	i was very very impressed at how quick the charger came plugged it into to my att quickfire n waalaaaa perfect definetly would order more items from sf/planet thanxxx
B002D3D2X4	it works but the phone it was made for it total and utter garbage. got it second hand and cheap but its just a crappy phone
B002D3D2X4	Instead of replacing my sons cell phone, we were able to find the charger only here!  Saved us hundreds of dollars
B002D3D2X4	The original charger has a prong to "clip" the charger onto the Quickfire. This one does NOT!!! grrSoooo I have to rig it up so that the connection stay on it.It's a pain in the azz.
B002D3D2X4	I WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THE CHARGER IT TOOK A LONG TIMETO GET TO ME AND ON TOP OF THAT THE DESCRIPTION SAID NEW, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY OLD AND BROKEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHARGING PART, THIS WAS A WAIST OF MONEY AND TIME!!!
B002D3D2X4	This charger is exactly what I was looking for.  The price was good and delivery was as promised.  I would definintely buy from this site again.
B002D3D2X4	Great price, quick shipping, worked perfectly!  I liked it better than the one my phone came with.  It was just a little different but less flimsy!  I think that about sums it up!
B002D3D2X4	Perfect charger for the phone my mom had. They don't carry these at the stores anymore and I got it at reasonable price to!
B002D3D2X4	solid construction. Works well. overall, I would say this is a good product and a good buy. This is also a good value.
B002D3D2X4	my daughter didn't think we would find a charger for her phone again...needless to say she was extremely happy when it showed at the door
B002D3D2X4	Although the charger seems to be working just fine, the item was listed as "new." When it arrived, it clearly wasn't new. It had scratches on its head and the metal prongs were slightly bent. I didn't return it because I payed a decent price for it and the cost of shipping would be more than the item.BOTTOM LINE:If you advertise something as new, that's the condition in which it should arrive.
B002D3D2X4	I ordered this charger to replace the one my new puppy chewed up!  It was a great price, arrived quickly, and does its job!
B002D3D2X4	My nephew lost his charger to his QuickFire, so I ordered this online. The phone charges, now! I have no complaints.
B00501IVU0	If you are a tech person you'll probably have no problem. I am not and was frustrated when I got it to find out that there weren't any chords that come with this. I guess I was supposed to know that. I also had trouble trying to figure out when it was charged as when it's plugged in it's always blue whether it's done or not. But I am technically challenged so keep that in mind. It is handy once you find chords in that you can charge two things at the same time in one outlet which takes up less space. I use it for my sansa zip clips and charge them both at the same time.
B00501IVU0	Works perfectly to charge my cellphones AND tablets, as well as my back-up Battery Power-Packs. No complaints whatsoever. I highly recommend it to anyone considering a purchase.
B00501IVU0	The Sandisk Sansa would no longer charge using the USB cable on the computer, but everything worked using this Adapter.
B00501IVU0	Nice and compact for travel. Having two ports is useful for powering or charging multiple units which the unit seems very capable of handling.
B00501IVU0	I have two versions of the SanDisk MP3 Player: the SanDisk sansa, and the SanDisk sansa clip zip.  Each player requires a slightly different cable connector.  The USB Connector that plugs directly into the computer is the same on both players; it's the end that plugs into the player that is different for both devices.After reading reviews of similar devices and noting complaints of the devices not fitting their version of SanDisk Player, I took a leap of faith and chose this one and I am very happy I did!  It is perfect.  I can charge both MP3 Players at the same time, and there is no problem with cables fitting the Charger because the end of the cable that plugs into the computer port plugs into this Charger, and then you plug the Charger into your electrical outlet.  The plug also emits a blue light while in use.So if you are looking for a Charger that connects to your wall outlet and will accommodate any device that connects to your computer drive via a USB port, this is the one to purchase.  Service was great from this Vendor.
