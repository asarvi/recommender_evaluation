B001C8GB6G	Easy to use, purchased for elderly person, she is able to use with no problems.  It is small and easy to store.
B001C8GB6G	I bought this for my blackjack and it works as advertised. i'm glad i bought this cell phone charger .
B001C8GB6G	Item was accurate as described, and came quickly! I would buy from this seller again!
B001C8GB6G	Received the items very quickly and they work fine.  Much better pricing then the AT&T store.
B001C8GB6G	This power cord for my blackjack is perfect fit just like the OEM one that i have at home.
B001C8GB6G	This charger turns the phone on and charges it.  Only been using a few days, but the plug fits into the phone well and the transformer(?) does not get hot.
B001RUW3JS	I got this product because I use my cell phone for watching videos as well as surfing the net and listening to music.  This product is great--it also functions as a battery holder for me. I just charge the battery, leave it in the charger and put the charger in my bag.  When I need to replace my battery, I take it out and put the dead battery in there and next time I'm home I just charge the dead one.  It keeps the dust and debris away from the battery contacts.
B001RUW3JS	Works just as described - lightweight option for a charger outside the phone. As others have mentioned, requires your charger cord to be attached to the unit. Also makes a nice cover/carrying case for a spare battery.
B001RUW3JS	Very good product.  Highly recommended.Displays yellow light while charging; green when completed.
B001RUW3JS	I had a hard time keeping my battery charged with the amount of use on my Blackberry. This device not only charges the extra battery, it also has a light which turns green when fully charged. For the price and lack of headaches, it is a true value purchase.
B001RUW3JS	Got this charger and a new battery for my Storm and now I just switch them out instead of having to plug my phone in daily. Verizon wanted $40 dollars just for the battery. I got a new battery and the charger for less than $20. If you want to be ripped-off by your cell phone company that is up to you?
B001RUW3JS	I am always paranoid of losing the use of my cell phone when the battery dies. Yes! This helps with my paranoia. I can now walk the streets with my phone confidently attached to my hip. No longer am I stuck in my office by the charger watching the bars on my phone go up and down. Im free!
B001RUW3JS	I do a lot of web surfing with my Blackberry, which drains my battery.  This extra battery is an OEM product, new condition, and is perfect.  I keep it charged and toss it in my bag when I travel or will be away from charging sources for extended periods of time.  I also live in a colder climate where travel can be challenging and we're always advised to keep a full tank of gas and a fully charged cell phone if we travel during difficult weather.  I do have a car charger as well as charging/sync cables, but find the extra battery is a great comfort for a very nominal price.  Plus, I'll have a replacement battery when my original one begins to fail from use.  Order one, it's a great insurance policy.
B001RUW3JS	It really works, it doesnt look like much when you open the package but it really does work. One thing to keep in mind is that this item is exactly what is pictured (minus the battery). It does not come with any cables, those are seperate.One thing I wish it did: I wish the light would turn off when finished charging.It charges the battery all the way and the light stays on till you remove the battery. There is no way to know when it is finished or how much is left.Other than that, it charges the battery and does not get hot.
B001RUW3JS	Very helpful device since the Storm is very wasteful of the battery. If the battery runs out, I use a spare battery and charge the empty one. So, the BB is always alive.. :-))
B001RUW3JS	It works great. It's compact and easy to use. No special plug needed. I debated on the desktop charger version but decided to use this since the compact version. Great product if you are a traveller and need that precious space. Down side, it's been a challenge to find the Blackberry Y Cable to charge both the Blackberry and the charger.
B001RUW3JS	I really liked having this charger since I always have a 2nd battery for my Blackberry Curve 8900 fully charged.  This works especially well when you are travelling since you can plug this one and let it charge while you are using your blackberry and then swap batteries.This is a well made product and you can plug your exisiting blackberry charger into this.  This uses a Micro USB input.
B001RUW3JS	I hate having to charge a battery while its in my phone.  Plus, if the battery is *really* dead it won't let you talk while charging.  This enables me to keep a fresh charged battery always on hand and let me charge the dead one without interruption!
B002CNM57E	Pantech Breeze 111 cell phone charger.  Arrived promptly, price was low and worked fine in charging my new cell  phone
B002CNM57E	The wire is  ltlle thin,  but charges well.  good price works well good spare charger you can carry with you
B002CNM57E	The shipping was super fast.  The charger works well.  It's not the fancy kind that also plugs into your computer but those are too expensive.
B002CNM57E	Works excellent bought two because of the price being so reasonable, an extra one at home and one to have at work. Fits well and does the job.
B002CNM57E	I purchased 3 of these very reasonably and keep them around my apartment.  They work as well as the one that came with my phone.
B002CNM57E	we ordered the wrong one. not their fault. we wanted a car charger and he thought travel meant just that.
B002CNM57E	This charger works great. My old one broke and ATT had none in the store and none to order. So I looked on Amazon and there it was, for a much better price!
B00508I5A4	I bought this for my Virgin Mobile LG Optimus Slider.  Works perfectly.  No complaints.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00508I5A4	I was so excited to get a new charger and when I got it, it didn't even work. I assumed it was just my phone but it didn't work on other people's phones. Waste of my money.
B00508I5A4	I received these chargers in a timely manner.  They all work great.  I had bought some chargers previously from another seller and they all broke really easy and stopped working.  So far we have had no problem with these.
B00508I5A4	Its a good fit. I got it to replace my kindle charger. Its as described and it also fits my phone. Amazing price. I'm happy so I guess that's all that matters.
B00508I5A4	Does the job at a very low price. Great deal. I would recommend to anyone.Don't hesitate to buy it. :-)
B00508I5A4	This is the original charger that is made for eht LG Optimus phone.  It works perfect, and it charges faster than other chargers that I have used.
B00508I5A4	It works great. It plugs into the wall very firmly and I am happy with the purchase so far. Actualy LG brand. no complaints.
B00508I5A4	Not what the picture is. The actual product is the usb cable and a second piece that fits into a wall outlet. I already had one of these and wanted the legit charger with a longer cord. Disappointed the product was not what the picture claims, but it still charges my phone either way.
B00508I5A4	This charger works as intended. It is an OEM LG charger and charges my phone as intendedThe charger than came with my phone would not work. I kept getting a message on the phone that the cordwas not recommended for the phone. So, I plugged in my iphone charger base and it worked ok. I wanted to besure I had the recommended charger for the particular LG VS750 phone so, I ordered this charger and it works great.
B00508I5A4	Worked very well for the short time I had it.  I switched to an iPhone and needed a different type of charger.
B00508I5A4	This is an actual LG brand charger, not generic.  Much longer and more flexible cord than the heavy USB cable that came with phone.  Great for keeping a backup in your travel bag.
