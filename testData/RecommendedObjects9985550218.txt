B000HS1EVE	I own three of the charges and many tips. I find them to be so much better than buying after market chargers that don't always work. And, with one in vehicle, we have much less clutter in the cars and RV.
B000HS1EVE	I haven't tried the car adapter yet, but so far, the AC adapter works well.  The only change I've made was to use a switch between the charger and the power strip I have it plugged into, to eliminate 'phantom loads', the small amount of power that things like this tend to use even when they're not charging anything.  My wife wanted to clean up the clutter from having so many different chargers around, and this solved the problem.  I'm using it to charge Samsung wireless phones, Sony and Palm PDAs, an iPod, a PSP, and a Nintendo DS.The only minor gripe I have is that since the various adapter plugs only plug into the adapter one way, the company should have had matching marks on both the plug and the cord so that you would know how to match them up.  Their solution is to have a very small, almost impossible to see, triangle on the cable.  It's hard to see because it's just a mark molded onto the end of the cable.  Of course, this is easily solved with your own mark made with a spot of paint.
B000HS1EVE	I bought this product for an extended US train journey to avoid carrying four separate chargers for two non-compatible cell phones and two non-compatible e-readers.  It worked great, seems sufficiently robust given careful use, and saved me a huge mess of plastic bricks and wires.  My only real gripe is that the carrying pouch supplied is not big enough for all the parts.  It's not easy to stuff everything in there, and you end up with a pretty awkward package.  But the bits work, and the product's flexibility is great.
B000HS1EVE	Used one for years, and multiple devices, until I smashed it.  Had to buy a new one to replace the borken one.  Have never had a problem with a tip, or getting a proper charge.
B000HS1EVE	I was very sad about this product.  I used to have one I bought years ago and finally needed a replacement.  It's so easy to switch from car to wall outlet.  You can still get all of the tips.  The bad ratings is because these wouldn't power up.  The company was easy to work with in providing replacement, but that one didn't work either.  So after getting two defective models, it wasn't worth trying again.  But they refunded all money and shipping.  Just wish the product would have worked.
B000HS1EVE	The charger itself is great and a great concept. I used to take it everywhere when I travelled as it's light and convenient.  However, the reason it only gets 3 stars is that they never made a tip for the Apple Lightening Connector, thus making this useless for my iPhone 5 and iPad.  Sadly, my inquiry to the company asking if they will be making a Lightning tip went unanswered.
B000HS1EVE	I purchased these items for my kids HTC phones as the original chargers were marginally functional.Delivery was fast ...and we have been very pleased with the units...I purchased one for my car some years ago and it is working fine to this day...I expect these units to continue that performance..I recomend the iGo brand without reservation.MIke S
B000HS1EVE	IGo chargers are extremely versatile and have worked well. I have had several for at least 4 or 5 years and have never had one fail. What makes them great is their versatility. When my family all travels together, we can do so with one charger. I have what I refer to as my "techno bag" with all my tips, adapters, splitters, etc. inside. I have tips for each phone in our family and just swap tips as needed. I also like the fact that I can take it out of the car, replace the adapter and plug it into the wall. I use that often: for example, when I go to get my car worked on and am low on charge. I am buying the Igo Everywhere for each family for a stocking stuffer this year.
B000HS1EVE	Terrible. You need a different end to use any of the enclosed. Worse then that they take different ends, Save your money.
B000HS1EVE	Lasted few months, then started acting on/off, eventually died. Tried to file a warranty claim, but it is not so easy -- no such form to be found on the manufacturer's site. Eventually received one email from support, and no follow up at all. Waste of time and money. Plenty of good products and companies out there, stay away from iGo.
B000VTPOT2	it only cost 1 cent with $8 shipping so its not too much, however, it doesnt charge too well.  if you leave it overnight it will charge but if you need a few minutes of charging it doesnt give you much.  i would suggest paying a few more dollars for the real thing
B000VTPOT2	This was such a great deal!  I got the charger very quickly and it works perfectly.  The cell phone company wanted to charge me $30 for the same product.  I'm so glad I found this!
B000VTPOT2	My phone needed a new charger. I am very pleased with this cahrger. Thank you.
B000VTPOT2	This charger was really useful until it broke on me a month and a half later.
B000VTPOT2	I purhcased this battery charger for my nokia phone.  It works great and was inexpensive.
B000VTPOT2	did a quick charge to my nokia phone while I had it.  A few months after buying this, my phone broke.  worked great while I had the phone.
B000VTPOT2	This product was under $3 WITH shipping. It came in early, works perfect, and I haven't had one problem with it. It even shuts off when the battery is full. I'll order from this company again.
B000VTPOT2	Price - unbelievableShipping - quick and efficientPerformance - questionable. Takes hours to fully charge phone and even then the retained charge does not appear to "hold" as compared to when charged with the original charger.
B000VTPOT2	It held its purpose for a bit, then started to wear off after a month or so. You get what you pay for.
B000VTPOT2	Great price ! Quick Shipping ! Exactly the same as original.Charges Nokia phone quickly.New Travel Charger for NokiaFor the professional executive on the go, this charger is a must! The travel charger is lightweight and easy to carry while traveling. Simply plug one end into the wall, the other into the phone or desktop charger, and it will recharge and condition your battery.Rapid Home Travel Charger (110-240v)Compatible With:Nokia: 6101, 6102, 6102i, 6103, 3155i, 6165i, E61, E62, 6126, 6131, 6133, 6136, 5300, N75, N95, N80, 6085, 6086, 7390, 7370, N91, 6282, E65
B000VTPOT2	This is a great item to charge your cell phone. It is very hard to find this in stores for the price you get charged
B000VTPOT2	Although I was not pleased with the product itself, I am very pleased with the service provided by the company. Upon hearing that the product was less than what I had expected, the company promptly offered me a full refund. I would consider other products sold by this company in the future.
B000VTPOT2	product on time, no problems. Just what I expected, not to mention the price, so cheap
B000VTPOT2	I received the product only a couple of days after ordering it - nice and quick service. And the product was as expected, so I had no problems at all.
B000VTPOT2	The first time I tried to pull it out of the wall, the cover came off in my hand, pulling out the circuit board and sundry wires along with it. This was not the result of a violent pull, just the normal way you would pull a plug out of a socket. When I tried to get the rest of it out of the wall, everything came off, but one metal pin remained in the socket! I have a bare metal pin sticking out of a wall electrical outlet at this point! Obviously very dangerous. I'll have to take it out with a very well insulated pair of pliers. This product should not be legal to sell in the United States.
B000VTPOT2	I started using this charger as soon as I received it. This charger charges my Nokia quickly. When I run my battery down to almost dead I can put it on the charger and it has a full charge in about an hour. My original charger was getting ready to die so I ordered this charger and I sure am glad I did. If you need a replacement or just a back up charger this is a good buy. Get it, its well worth it!
B000VTPOT2	Good bargain ,I do not understand ,does it mean you can use with 110/240 watt? Please explain to me how
B000VTPOT2	This is a great charger, and the price can't be beat.  It arrived quickly as promised.  No complaints!
B000VTPOT2	I would use Bargain cell again. No problems at all.Nokia 6101, 6102, 6102i, 6103, 3155i, 6165i, E61, E62, 6126, 6131, 6133, 6136, 5300, N75, N95, N80, 6085, 6086, 7390, 7370, N91, 6282, E65 Rapid Home Travel Charger (110-240v)
B000VTPOT2	If you are looking for a charger with long cord don't go for it. It can't even reach my office desk from the switch under it. With such low price I was not expecting much any way, Import thing is it charges your cell phone.
B001TI261I	I thought I was ordering the right charger and was disappointed when the charger arrived and didn't fit my phone.  Bargincell customer service discovered that they did have a charger that would work for my phone and sent it out at no charge!  I didn't even have to return the charger that didn't work.  A new charger from the original manufacturer would have cost five times what I paid.  Thank you Bargincell!
B001TI261I	Very cheaply made and fell apart the 2nd week. Also it's bulky and the cord isn't all that long. It works
B001TI261I	I brought this product for little or nothing because I gave away my original to my neice, and it works just like the original one. Don't like the red light on it, but it's fine. No problems.
B001TI261I	love it. I brougt this cell phone charger on 9/30/11. it only take a week of me to get it in the mail.
B001TI261I	Exactly as shown. I like the light on it when it is charging. Fits phone. Have a great summer everyone
B00508I46E	This charger works perfectly with my HTC One. I'm a very happy customer and I highly recommend this wall charger.
B00508I46E	I bought a duplicate of the original charger that came with my HTC EVO. It's durable and has a long cord that is useful when the electrical socket isn't conveniently placed. Yes, I paid more than some other chargers cost, but I wanted a known, dependable product. Now with both chargers I have options as to where I charge my phone.
B00508I46E	The charger works perfectly! It arrived in good timing and is exactly what the decribtion said! I am very pleased with my purchase! It was a great price!
B00508I46E	So far the charger is working just fine. I haven't had any problems out of yet and have had it for quite some time now.
B00508I46E	I bought this charger for my HTC Incredible 2, it charges my phone as expected, I only wish it were a little longer, but the price was good and it appears to be OEM.
B0050JJI2M	Works great! Fits perfectly in my Samsung Mesmerize phone. What more can I say. I like to have a few extra chargers. One for upstairs, one for work and one for downstairs.
B0050JJI2M	Bought two chargers with detachable USB cables for my Samsung Droid phone, great price and they work great! A little bigger than the original charger, but not by much.
B0050JJI2M	First one was faulty HOWEVER, got a second one no problem and I did not have to do anything they sent it out. I give it 4 stars because the cord could be a little longer but it is WORTH THE MONEY.
B0050JJI2M	The price is right, the product is functional. What more can you ask? It also came on time. I highly recommend it. Half the price of what you have to pay  in Walmart.
B0050JJI2M	This item works as well as the factory one that came with my phone. Oh wait that's because it is like the factory one that came with my phone. Only difference is that this one is only 1/4 of the price you pay at the cell phone stores. Save a little money here and buy this great item.
B0050JJI2M	I keep leaving my cords someplace. I needed extra one these were the right price and they have micro USB is a great plus.
B0050JJI2M	It a functional charger and what I needed, but be careful of the very short chord.  It makes it difficult to move it very much while it's charging.Other than that, perfect.
B0050JJI2M	I have purchased several different chargers for my Samsung Droid Charge.  This one is in the middle of the pack.Pros1. It does work well - it charges with the USB cable.2. The charger is what was pictured - it is cheap.Cons1. The cord is too short.  It is impossible to plug in and leave on the front of table.  The short cord means the phone ends up someplace dangerous (i.e. the floor).  The charger cord is only 30 inches long, which is far shorter than the factory genuine USB charger.  I am guessing the original charger cord was around 4-5 feet. (I don't think they should call it &#34;genuine&#34; if it isn't factory.)2. The preview pictures also have a blue lanyard?  Where was that? lol.  Amazon should get rid of that picture - has nothing to do with the product.
B0050JJI2M	This is OEM.  It arrived in time and as described.  Works flawlessly.  It's a little larger than the Samsung OEM 1.0A Travel USB Wall Charger (which I also ordered and works just as well).  I would recommend this item to a friend.
B0050JJI2M	This works great and is a genuine charger. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the cord is about 3' long and not the most functional for me. I just have to have an extension cord in my office to charge. Other than that no complaints and would recommend.
B0050JJI2M	Purchased this to replace a charger that had gone bad. I compared it to the original and it is in fact the same. Works exactly as I had hoped and I am very pleased.
B0050JJI2M	Bought this as a back up to my original charger. Has definitely helped ensure my BF and I don't fight over whose charger the other has swiped. I used a little finger nail polish to distinguish mine from his and things have been fab.Provides a great charge for my S4.
B0050JJI2M	I've purchased some crappy chargers in the past and this is not one of them. Works perfectly. Will buy again.
B0050JJI2M	It says it is genuine Samsung but the usb cord is much shorter than the original so it can't be the exact same charger. I will only buy a replacement charger in the future that specifies cord length. In my opinion this cord is too short. It does work but hard to place down on any real surface while charging because of cord length.
B0050JJI2M	My travel bags are always packed wth this charger.  I do not have to worry about not packing one for travel
B0050JJI2M	Direct replacement of lost charger. Other off the shelf chargers were all one piece chargers.  I wanted the convenience of the detachable cable.
B0050JJI2M	The only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is that the cord is about half the length of the OEM cord, and that makes it less convenient depending on where you need to plug it in.
B0050JJI2M	I don't like taking my regular charger when I travel (don't want to be screwed if I forget it somewhere) so I bought this as a backup charger/travel charger. It appears to be a genuine Samsung product and works well on Samsung Galaxy (1st generation), Motorola Atrix, Blackberry Bold, and Samsung Galaxy S4 phones (it's got lower current rating than the standard S4 charger so it takes a little longer to get the job done).
B00691RL6K	My last charger broke so I hope this one lasts longer, it seems to be more durable at least. Sometimes it is better to pay a little more for a product.
B00691RL6K	Works perfectly.  Charges my Galaxy S3 as fast as the OEM charger.  All USB chargers are NOT created equal.  This charger is clearly able to handle the high 1.0amp requirements of the S3
B00691RL6K	This charger is a little larger than typical but you can charge two items at once.  I like the fact that it charges my HTC phone just as fast (if not faster) then the wall charger that came with it.  Some other chargers that I have had charge much slower.I also like that this charger is horizontal when it is plugged into a wall socket.  Most other chargers of this type are vertical and therefore make the other half of the outlet useless.
B00691RL6K	It works really nicely and I love the adapter for apple products so I only need one charger for my android phone and my ipod. My only complaint is that the cinch storage pouch had the clamp break the first time I tried to tighten it.
B00691RL6K	Charger bigger than appears or would seem to be.  Included iphone charger attachment did not work and had to return.  went for something smaller via the bay.
B00691RL6K	Works like expected; charges iPad and Samsung Infuse at the same time. Nice convinent carry pouch too. Worth every penny!
B00691RL6K	This charger is really made for another type of smart phone.  It comes  with this tiny adaptor head that you connect at the tip to connect your iPhone or iPad device.  It did not seem stable but worse than that it did not work.  I wish I had payed attention to another review I read about a little too late.  I now have to pay for return shipping on top of having a worthless item.
B00691RL6K	Takes 120VAC, 12VDC AND 24VDC. I leave this in my car, and when I go to a friend's house I can charge from the wall. When I go on a boat or in someone else's car I can plug it in and charge (and someone else's phone too, lots of power!). AND if I go flying in 24V planes, it still works. My phone can run GPS without draining. Such a nice product.
B00691RL6K	Just bought third one of these in a year - Wife stole first one and kids took other one.  Great having one charger to keep in backpack for hotel use and for car when I travel.  Low current (less than 2.1 A) doesn't allow charging of iPad but still gives a lower rate charge.
B00691RL6K	1 month after I got this, it burned out for some reason. Had it to my wall to charge my ipad and phone. Don't bother with this cheap product. :( I was really bummed about it.
B00691RL6K	Overall I'm pleased with this charger. I really like the fact that it's a 3 in 1 so I don't need to carry around a bunch of different chargers. I have a samsung galaxy s ii and this charges the phone almost as quickly as the samsung charger, so I can't complain about that. One thing I've noticed is that I my computer doesn't recognize the phone when connected using this product's usb cable, so my guess is it cannot be used for data transfer. I haven't checked it in a while to see if that is still the case or whether I had incorrect settings. Otherwise I would recommend this product.I forgot to mention that I have used it to charge my ipod with very good results. Definitely enjoy being able to charge the ipod in the car if need be for a good price.
B00691RL6K	Love this charger. It allows me to charge my phone in the car and I can charge my wife's phone in the car at the same time. great for charging at home or on the road. It's handy to have both in one package.
B00691RL6K	I had searched for a charger like this for a long time and had only found ones that were too expensive, only had one USB port, or plugged in vertically.  I was excited to finally find one that had all the features I wanted.Regarding it's usefulness, there's not much to say other than it's a dual USB charger that has both DC (car) and AC (home) plugs and it charges any USB powered item well.  It does what it advertises and is a good price, making this exactly what I had hoped for.The extra charger cover and pouch are superfluous and aren't necessary in my mind.  They don't really add anything for me and I don't use them at all, but some people may like them.On the downside, the charger's size is the only negative I can find and is the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars.  The size/bulkiness makes me have to be creative with how I plug it into my car charging ports, though it still works just fine.  I have a Honda Accord and with a USB cord plugged in, it's too long to be able to use it in the port in my center console as it hits the top shelf and doesn't allow me to close the lid.  The charging port in the base of the dash has a flip cover over it for protection and the width/bulk of the charger makes it so that there's only one way I can plug it in without straining the flip cover and even then it's a tight fit.  Overall a minor annoyance, but when I'm on the phone and hear my low battery warning, I wish I could just grab it and plug it in without worrying about the orientation of it and having to focus on that for a moment.Pros:Dual USB portsHorizontal plug-inGreat PriceCons:Size/BulkinessOverall I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a travel charger that they can take from the car to the house and is perfect for road trips to cover all charging bases.
B00691RL6K	This charger is superb a little on the Big size but yet Compacted into a multi use AC/DC charger that functions great!!!
