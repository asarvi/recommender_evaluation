B002HRE1X6	first of all the picture is not a true representation of the product. the screen protector only goes to the top of the buttons not around it. the product looks and feels like something you would pay $2 for. impossible to get all the bubbles out. the screen protector is definately not "anti glare."will never purchase from amzer again, also ordered a case for my nokia 5800 which was cheap. the 2 pieces of plastic were noticably differnt shades of white and were very difficlult to get off once on. poor company. dont give them your money.
B002HRE1X6	I don't recommend this item. The squegee does not remove the air bubbles. It makes the screen hard to view.
B004BVETOM	These screen protectors are for the T-Mobile My Touch 4g aka, HTC Glacier. These are some of the best screen protectors I have purchased from amazon, or anywhere for that matter. They are crystal clear, pretty easy to apply, they even give you a wiping cloth which works OK, you can also use a LINT FREE microfiber cloth. Also included are rubber finger protectors so you don't get fingerprints on the backside of the screen protector or on the screen itself. You will see better results if you apply the screen protector in an area where there is little to no dust particles floating around, they can stick to the back or land on the screen while you are fiddling with applying the screen protector. I recommend lining this up with the bottom of the screen nearest the genius/home buttons and press it on upwards, the fit isn't exact, but its close enough that i don't see a problem with it. The cut outs for the front facing camera and proximity sensor are just a tad off center of the lens/sensor, but are big enough that the clear cover doesn't overlap them and look bad, it's just not 'perfect'.
B004GNW2T4	Great product it protects screen they sent it very fast it arrived in three days and it was very easy to installI'm happy that i bought it
B004RBP0TE	This may be a good screen protector; however, I won't know since it is too much hassle. Here's the sequence: Remove battery (if possible), clean screen with soapy water, wet the protector with the soapy water, attach the screen protector, squeegee the excess water as the protector is attached, wait 24 hours for everything to dry, and re-install the battery. Besides the installation, I disliked that the protector was adhered to the inside of the envelope with a dab of glue. The glue would have to be removed prior to attachment. I did like the little squeegee and cloth that were included. I used them when attaching a different company's screen protector.
B004RBP0TE	Super product.  The best part is how you apply it.  You wet it first and then apply it.  By wetting it you can move it around until it is just right - not like those get it right the first time or you get a sticky mess.
B004RBP0TE	I order this product based on all the good reviews but i recieved one badly damaged. UPDATE i contacted them and they were happy to solve my issue. Long story short i highly suggest buying this screen prottector its the best i have ever bought and customer service is beyond great in helping you...
B004RBP0TE	So far this is the best screen protection. I install this screen protection at 11:00pm and in morning around at 9:30am it was done no bubbles, nothing. if you follow the instruction and watch some video on YouTube you are good to go and ya this is my first screen protection installation. Does fit Lg Optimus V or S because both are the same phones. First 3 days felt kind a sticky because use to the regular screen only.
B004RBP0TE	This screen protector is the best I've used for ridding itself of bubbles. However, the screen protector is soft and gets scarred easily, so part of your screen view is clouded by the protector. The softness of it makes it more difficult to do finger swipes on your phone than other screen protectors I've used.The application process is the most difficult of any screen protector I've used and while it does get bubbles out, your tradeoff is to have lint and fingerprints underneath the protector unless you are in some kind of cleanroom when you do the install.This is the first screen protector I've really considered taking off the phone within a week of installation. I'd rather have a more conventional screen protector.
B004RBP0TE	It doesn't come with as much stuff as the other reviews make it out to be. Its the same as what you would get in the mall for $40 that the guy installs. Its obviously more difficult to do it yourself, but you save money! We ordered two, and the one on my phone worked great, my husband got a bit of dust under his that drove him crazy, but he didn't bother changing it. Just follow the directions!
B004RBP0TE	This thing was easy to apply, simple directions, and it made my scratched up Optimus v look like a new phone. The protector film literally made all of the old scratches disappear.The people who complain about the amount of time you can't use your phone for after applying the protector are either not actually using the product or are just not very bright. I was using my phone 5 minutes after applying the thing.
B004RBP0TE	Got this after trying the regular plastic stick ons. The instructions were a little confusing, but the results are great.Clean the phone, soak the protector+backing in soapy water, remove from backing, apply protector to phone, make sure it's sitting straight, squeegie with the provided card, and let it dry.It worked like a charm, and the little bit of fuzziness went away overnight, like the instructions said. Very clear, good fit, and not noticeable like the plastic ones.
B004RBP0TE	The scree protector did its job and provided unprecedented protection against every day disasters. The only downside was the protector wasn't crystal clear but kind of foggy. Also this protector wasnt a static cling kind,  but the kind that you have to wet down and smooth out and i found out that this was more difficult than I expected. All in all I give it mediocre props because of it un-clearness and its difficult installation process.
B004RBP0TE	I would recommend this item fits good very clear,went on easy my 11 year old put hers on,like it;;rock on..
B004RBP0TE	Was fairly easy to put on and I love it!  Much clearer that the last one I had on my phone.
B004RBP0TE	It's just bad. They have you apply it in a really weird way. Just a bad experience. Wish it had a better quality to it.
B004RBP0TE	Ill never know what the product is like it never came glad I didn't pay a fortune for it I woulda have been very pissed
B004RBP0TE	Just plain old simple. THE BEST. It doesn't even get ANY scratches. Gets rid of scratches on the screen as well when you apply the thing. I'm guessing it's from the water filling it up, even if you  squeegy out the rest. Correct me if I'm wron ;^ )
B004RBP0TE	It's a lengthy process to apply the screen, but I'm happy with the results. Only thing worth noting is that the air bubbles under the screen lasted longer than indicated in the instructions, which said that all bubbles should disappear within 3 days. I was worried when 3 days passed and there were still a few noticeable air bubbles under my screen. I was ready to write a negative review, but I thought I'd give it a chance and wait a little longer. At the end of the week, the bubbles were finally gone. So don't get too worried if you have some air bubbles that linger for several days.
B004RBP0TE	Was super easy to apply has stood up to everything i've thrown at it. the first one i got had a bubble within the sheet itself and told them about that and they promptly sent me a replacement for it. Anything i did get on it wiped off with little effort. i'd buy one again.
B004RBP0TE	A bit difficult to install compared to others like it but it definately does the job. Made of a softer plastic that is scratch resistant.
B004RBP0TE	I was excited to find another product other than ZAGG invisible shield because i feel their product is overpriced, so when i saw this for a good price i jumped on it.  the installation was a little difficult and i was left with a few bubbles, but they aren't on the viewing part of the screen so it wasn't a big deal.  i've had it on for over a month now and it's held up nice so far.  i am happy wit the purchase.
B004RBP0TE	Great sturdy screen protector. My brother saw mine and immediately asked me to order one for him also. Very clear.
B004RBP0TE	Was very unhappy with this product.  I have used several screen protectors on my phones over the years and this was the worst.  Very complicated to put on.  All the others I have used in the past you just stick on. This one required using soapy water.  I didn't like the idea of putting water on my phone, mostly because messing up your phone with water will void your waranty, they will not replace the phone if it is damaged by water.  I wouldn't recomend this product. Thanks.
B004RBP0TE	It came inside a normal envelope, inside the normal envelope was a piece of cardboard folded over the screen protector. I interpreted this piece of cardboard as the backing, so when I installed the protector it was hazy/cloudy/blurry even three days after installing it. Once I took off the backing, you could barely tell the screen protector was there.The customer service was great in helping me with my problems. I do wish there was a video as I had never used this type of screen protector before.In the end, I recommend it and would purchase again.
B004RBP0TE	I have used several different devices with several different screen protectors.  Typically they are peel and stick and take a couple of seconds to apply.  This product comes with a full page of instructions on how to apply it in an 8 step process!  Unlike others I have used, this one requires liquid soap and water to apply.  Because of that, the instructions suggest removing the battery before applying the screen protector.The entire application should only take "25-45 minutes" to complete.  Then "Allow any excess water to dry.  As a safety precaution allow the phone to dry for 3-5 hours before replacing battery in phone.  Be aware that it can take 2-3 days for the skin to fully 'cure' and for bubbles and imperfections to clear"  There is an additional conflicting cautionary statement that says "As a safety precaution allow the phone to dry for 24 hours before replacing battery in phone.  Even though 8 hours generally would be enough"I suppose if you didn't need to use your phone for 24 hours and were an incredibly patient person, this would be a good product for you.Unfortunately, I can't comment on the application process or the fit from personal experience because, to be honest, I just don't have the patience!  It doesn't seem any sturdier than any other screen protector, so it looks like I will be searching for something else.
B004RBP0TE	Product required soapy water to apply.  I was concerned about this at first because water and cell phones don't mix.  I removed the battery before installing the cover as instructed.  After a couple of tries it installed okay with minimal air bubbles.  Several hours after initial application, the bubbles disappeared and the cover is flawless.  I initially had some small scratches on my cell phone screen.  After applying the Xtreme guard, I can no longer see the scratches!  This is the best cover I've had.  The company is very responsive to customer satisfaction and goes out of their way to make sure you're satisfied with the product.  In short, excellent product, excellent vendor.
B004RBP0TE	It is a true smart phone. Its adaquate. Nothing to shout about. But good for the price.You can do email, access maps, do most things that phones of this vintage will doThe camera is ok , can edit and get a decent picture. Has a great built in fm radio.IF you're a cheap skate, like me, and you just want adaquate, this is the phone.Calls,Text, email, web, camera, radio, hell, what else is there?
B004RBP0TE	I really appreciate this product.  Without it I am sure I would have cracked the screen on my phone already as it is always in the bottom of my purse.  Thanks so much.
B004RBP0TE	I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who owns an Optimus V phone.One thing to note, there are 2 layers.The top layer looks 'Matte', under that is your screen protector.After you place the screen protector, align it and remove any air bubbles, let it sit as they instruct.Then remove this top 'Matte' layer. It protects your real screen protector from getting damaged while removing air bubbles
B004RBP0TE	This product was immediately received and I followed instructions.  It worked great.Don't be afraid of having to use a "little soapy water."  This is the best screen saverI have used and I am very particular.  It was worth the extra money for a quality product.
B00506X8J4	If you use the Cling plastic wrap and cut to the screen size, you may have better screen for your phone than this screen protection.  It is not smooth, looks ugly and cheap. I threw it away.  If you have a few dollars to throw away, then order this screen protection.
B005FC66TM	I would not recommend this product. The product is totally different than what the picture shows. If you are buying it for HTC Sensation 4G, then you would end up returning it. The reason is- the protector does not cover the entire screen. When I asked the seller, they gave some weird reasons for it being smaller than the screen. It is not good at all. Imagine you swiping your finger on the screen and each time you are obstructed by the thick bevel of the film itself. DON'T BUY THIS. Please save your time and money.
B005XHB6AS	Went on ok, and has a nice feel to touch.  But does not seem to be as well as hoped for.  Starting to get a few shiney dots all over the screen after about a month.
B005XHB6AS	That's just one word I use to describe the screen protector I got for my phone. It has served me long and well!
B005XHB6AS	Great value!  Works great and instructions are very detailed and easy to follow.  Have had for about 2 months and no issues.
B005XHB6AS	had it on my phone about a year and a half, works really good, dropped my phone a few times and not had any scratches.
B005XHB6AS	This is the screen protector for the T-Mobile MyTouch LG smartphone. It does require a bit of soapy water to apply, as well as some patience and a steady hand (a bit tricky - check some youtube videos on applying screen protectors to see how it goes). However, if you follow the packaging instructions exactly you will have a very rugged and usable screen protector for a great price. Once applied it takes a day or two for all the bubbles to smooth out, and then maybe a day or two for the "feel" of the screen to become ideal. We've had them on our phones for several weeks now, and I think they feel smoother than the original naked screen! I haven't had to make use of the lifetime warranty, but I saved the packaging and plan to get new ones if these get tattered/worn.FYI - this item arrives in an envelope that looks suspiciously like an advertisement - make sure to check your mail before throwing anything out!
B005XHB6AS	1. "Shipped" in an envelope. Second of two films had a big scuff mark on it.2. The film is a rubbery sticky mess. You'll have to oil it up to make actions like swiping comfortable.3. There's no "tap" to pull off the backing; you'll need tweezers because one figerprint on the adhesive side and you're done.4. Because the film is so flimsy, once the backing is off it droops and is extremely difficult to align properly.5. They are *extremely* statically clingy. After my third attempt to apply it, the adhesive side was already covered in crap.So unless you have a sealed room with no air circulation and a lot of patience, get something else.
B005XHB6AS	this is garbage, don't buy. its a knock off anyway. it doesn't work, not smooth plastic, and tossed it the same day.
B0076ZZ368	I always put these on my electronic devices. I have tried other manufactures but always come back to Lexerd. They are simple to put on and seem to last forever.
