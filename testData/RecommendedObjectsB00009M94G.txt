B003WK8YX0	The screen protector is slightly smaller than the actual screen area. I was ok with that because I have a rubber case which will cover the unprotected area but what really disappoint me is the quality of this product. After applying it for a week, all the edges of the screen protector are still lifted up despite what the founder told me.I emailed the manufacturer and here's what Liza (Lexerd founder I believe) told me:"The protector needs time to conform to the surface of the screen after it's been applied. After a week or so of use, the edges will begin to cling better to your screen.You may see a small area of the corner that may stay slightly lifted. This is the force lifting the edges up because of protector's rigidity is stronger than the force clinging to the screen. And because of the protector's properties, the slight lift will be invisible once your device is turned on. The light and vibrant colors pass right through and it becomes invisible.No worries! Over time and use, the edges will automatically find itself conformed and settled onto your screen."To me, the screen protector is either too thin or it just lack a bit of stickiness. I wish I spent the $14.54 on a different product.
B003WK8YX0	Want to spend a smart $10.00 to protect your gorgeous Samsung Captivate screen? Then look no further my friend. Lexerd cares, and it shows. They give you the tools to put it on, instructions, and a high quality product. It was easy to apply, and looks good. Like the guy said in another review, the edge shows slightly, but otherwise is pretty darn near perfect in all other respects. You need a protector? Buy this one!
B003WK8YX0	So I bought universal screen protectors and they blew bubbles and everything.I bought these best 10 bucks I've spent.  They are same price as the universal ones but fit your phone so no cutting to the right size.  It took me five mins to put this on they give you the tools to help make it easier.  Screen cleaning cloth, Rubber finger things and instructions that are detailed.  Great product would buy again and most likely will.  I only had one bubble upon installation and it only took a sec to get it out.Great product keep it up Lexerd.
B003WK8YX0	I don't usually get excited enough about a product to write a review, but I must say this is an exception.I had a screen protector on my iPod Touch (came with the case, don't remember the brand), but it was thick and affected the sensitivity of the screen and pulled it off after a week.  The Lexerd is quite a bit thinner and seems to have no impact on the capacitive screen of my Capture.  It was a little trickier to apply, being more flexible.I messed around with the one for my phone and got way more crap underneath it than when I applied on onto my wife's phone.  My recommendation is to get it in place and stick it down in one go, working the bubbles out by smooshing (technical term) them to the edge.  Playing with it trying to get all the air out when sticking it down is only going to make it worse.  When my screen is off I have a few visible bubbles from dust underneath the protector, but when the screen is on they're practically invisible and wholly unnoticeable.  I've decided to leave it just as it is until it needs replacing and when that time comes I'll try the trick of running a shower before applying a new one.  I will definitely be replacing it with another Lexerd product.
B003WK8YX0	PRODUCT GOES ON VERY EASY.  NICE TO BE ABLE TO JUST LIFT IT BACK UP AND REAPPLY IF NOT PLACED EXACTLY CORRECT THE FIRST TIME.  TOUCH SCREEN STILL WORK LIKE ORIGINAL, NO DISPLAY GLARE.  FAST SHIPPING, WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.
B003WK8YX0	Despite the small size of the package, it came with the screen protector, a microfiber cloth, two finger cots and a small plastic card to use as a squeegee.  The screen is crystal clear and the application was a snap.  Just be sure to take your time, follow the instructions and are in a dust free environment.The screen protector fits perfectly and the touch screen sensitivity is only reduced a tiny amount.  You notice it a little a first, particularly with the "fixed" keys at the bottom of the Captivate, but compared to other screen protectors I've used, this is top notch. Like with all plastic protectors, you won't have the perfectly smooth glass "glide" of an unprotected screen, but again compared to other screen protectors this one is one of the best. Once you apply the protector you will notice a tiny "edge" around the screen where it doesn't seem like it is adhering. However, it is uniform all the way around the screen, quite small and you have to really look to notice. Bubbles are easy to remove with the enclosed plastic card, just be sure to be gentle when squeegeeing them to the sides.The only downside to the true view is that it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet.  Not bad considering so is the Captivates screen.Good work Lexerd.
B003WK8YX0	The screen protector was very easy to apply.  Just wipe your phone's display, peel the backing off of the protector, and stick it on.  It has a semi-adhesive backing, so there is no liquid adhesive solution or squeegee to deal with.  I originally had a Zagg Invisible Shield (Universal Fit model) installed on my phone, but I purchased this Lexerd protector to replace it because I was so dissatisfied with the Zagg.  The Zagg Invisible Shield had a negative effect on screen clarity.  It was by no means invisible.  This Lexerd protector is barely noticeable on my phone, and it does not appear to have any impact on the display.I cannot attest to it's durability yet, because I just installed it today.  The protector does seem to be of high quality though.I would highly recommend this product.
B003WK8YX0	I just received this product and it really IS a great purchase!!  I am so glad I listened to the previous reviews and gave this screen protector a try.  It is very easy to install and has no bubbles.  Previously, I had cut a screen protector to fit my phone and it looked horrible....this one you can barely even notice it is on my phone and it is very easy to clean.  I am "sold" on Lexerd products and will buy their screen protectors from this day forward!!  Definitely worth the price!!
B003WK8YX0	I've ordered these before. Great cut, fit, and feel. Feels like i never put a screen protector on in the first place. These come with a couple of finger cots to ensure a fingerprint free installation. Highly recommend for Captivate.
B0040JHHE4	This product arrived quickly; it was easy to follow the installation directions and it's a terrific screen protector.  At this price, it's an amazing value.
B0040JHHE4	Once again I am impressed with the quality of the ZAGG screen protectors.  This product is easy to install if you follow the included directions.  It is also very durable.  I have dropped my phone with this product on it and the screen is completely protected.  I have only managed to leave a scratch in the protector once and that is with my very active four year old using and abusing the phone.
B0040JHHE4	I like how this protection Shield went on to my blackberry, as long as I used the supplied liquid spray with the application. Make sure you follow the directions and put the pieces in the right locations. However, I found that after applying the shield, cases that were made for the BlackBerry torch no longer fit properly, and were too snug, even with the very thin shield applied. I have removed all of the shield from my device except on the very back. Simply because my cases did not fit properly
B0040JHHE4	Dont buy this product!!! i ordered, but it will never arrive in my house! i wait days and days but useless!
B0040JHHE4	The installation of this product wasnt hassle free. I had to struggle to remove the bubbles. Not worth buying it again
B0040JHHE4	Bought this here at Amazon and put on my Blackberry a while back and it has held up just fine. I even have a child who like to nibble on everything. Phone included.I did not put it on myself. I recruited a friendly neighbor.
B0040JHHE4	In short, this is by far the best plastic material I had ever seen and used to protect and enhance a cell phone screen.
B004AHGOEK	These screen protectors are nothing more than clear rubber stickers.  Plastics can be very hard and durable or very rubberized and stretchy and anywhere in between.  These are at the far end of rubbery like a sandwich bag.  There are no tabs to help peel or apply the sticker, just a cardboard backing with no slit in it so you necessarily have to start at the corner and physically touch the sticky side of the protector.  The instructions say to use a credit card to remove air bubbles after application.  If you drag a credit card across these screen protectors it will leave visible gouges.  Again, it's very rubbery so anything sharper than a billiard ball will catch on the screen and scratch it.
B004AHGOEK	I've gotten the hang of applying the more durable, self-adhesive, screen protectors flawlessly, but this being the static-cling type was a nightmare. Luckily I bought a 5-pack so I had some to practice with. The nature of the vinyl makes it very hard to apply without getting flecks of dust underneath, even with a clean workspace. This is relatively thin as well, so more likely to bubble, and did not come with a typical squeegee like most self-adhesive protectors do. Overnight most of the bubbles disappeared, I guess the plastic is gas-permeable. Really I can't complain much for 5/$4 with free shipping, but next time I'll buy the thicker, removable, self-adhesive type, scratch resistant and designed for styluses.
B004AHGOEK	This product is AMAZING!!! :) They shiped the item to me fast!!!! Right when I put the screen protector on my phone there was no air bubbles. They send you five but I have only used on and I actually saved my phone from scratches!!!!! :) I will buy from them again!!!!!!!!!!
B004AHGOEK	These fit well and last a long time.  I still have 3 left and it's been almost a year since I bought it.
B004AHGOEK	Usually when I use something like this, it's electrostatic.. This particular screen guard is not. It has some kind of weird sticky glue on it, and you have to work out a lot of the bubbles. The instructions to apply it correctly are quite complicated. It's also thicker than what you'd expect from a screen guard. I guess that's why thy call it extreme
B004AHGOEK	These make it a little difficult to use touch screen.  They don't recognize exactly where your fingertips are touching while this is on so I am not using them.  Great price, seller and shipping.  Thanks
B004AHGOEK	it was thinner than what I had expected. and somehow it manages to shrink over a month long. what you buy is what you get.
B004AHGOEK	These screen protectors work awesome! Since first putting one on my phone in February, it has not starting peeling or coming off at all!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this product for the panctech crux phone!!
B004AHGOEK	These screen protectors work great. Took my time applying it to the phone and it paid off!  Fits fine, no air bubbles.
B004AHGOEK	I love not having to cut one of these to fit my phone.  It's custom sized for the Pantech Cruz and works great!
B004AHGOEK	I purchased these screen protectors for my phone. They were terrible, couldn't get them on, then when we did they fell off.Don't waste your money
B004AHGOEK	This works while it sticks.  I'm very rough on products like this, and it didn't stay on my phone very long. This will work great under normal conditions!
B004AHGOEK	Not much you can say about screed protectors. These are about as good as it gets. They have lasted pretty long and the price was right! Nothing bad about that! Definately recommend.
B004AHGOEK	Shipped very quickly the product was just as described will definatly keep the cell face cleaner. Look forward for more items in the future.
B004AHGOEK	The clear plastic is the kind that stretches, so there are tons of bubbles that you have to work out.
B004AHGOEK	Great product please with all everything. I would most defiantly reorder if I still had this phone. Unfortunately the phone is out of commission.
B004S8C2X8	This product did a good job of doing exactly what it was advertised to do. I have no problems at all with this screen protector.
B004S8C2X8	Its a good product for the money, but there are better ones out there for a little more money, can't complain for the price I paid
B004S8C2X8	I love the cell phone screen protectors.  I have an older touch screen and they really do give the screen added life.  Would use seller again.
B004S8C2X8	I was extremely happy with the product.  It was received as ordered and in a quick manner.  I highly recommend it.
B004S8C2X8	First of all, why do they make these things so hard to put on?  I had to go thru most of them and throw them away until I finally got one right.  But I think it's like that with all of these things.  You have to be in a completely dust, lint, and finger print free zone to get one of these things on perfectly.  But, it was the exact size and they came with a lint cloth.  So far the film has held up great on the phone.  Good deal.
B005450YHU	Great protection
B005450YHU	I have seen older phones with screens ruined by nicks and scratches. I had an experienced clerk at the store put it on for me. After it was on, it fit perfectly.  The cutout for the speaker is a bit too wide, otherwise it might be difficult to see that a shield was installed.  My phone is usually in the front pocket of my jeans, and the shield gets dirty, dusty, and shows finger smears.  I use my eyeglasses cleaning kit (optical spray and cleaning cloth) and the screen then looks like new.The shield includes a subtle "pattern" that is designed to reduce glare and reflection. And, that pattern seems to help, as I am able to clearly see the screen when I am outdoors or under bright lights.The store staff said that moisture is trapped under the shield during installation and that the screen becomes more transparent in two or three days.  In a week, the screen was "invisible" unless you looked closely.But, after about four months, the Zagg screen got "foggy" looking.  I removed it, and my phone's screen had a "sticky" texture that made gliding gestures difficult.  Using eyeglass cleaner, I was eventually able to reduce the stickiness and after a few weeks, the screen was a smooth as new.I chose to go without a screen protector.  My screen got zillions of very light, very minor scratches that can be seen when the screen is turned off, but those scratches are NOT visible when the screen is at normal brightness levels.  Because the screen is brighter, sharper and clearer without the Zagg, I don't mind the minor scratches on my screen.
B005450YHU	Some of the other reviews make this product seem scary, well they must be morons because this shield was the easiest one I have ever installed on my phone I have gone threw at least 8 CHEAP screen covers in the past year of having my phone, everytime there would be bubbles or the corners wouldnt go down not with this one.  My sister also has had this on her iPhone for 1 year NO problems.I installed this following the instructions to a T, and I barely even had to use the squeegee.For real get this product, you can thank me later!
B005450YHU	This was so highly recommended, however I am not impressed.  Installation was a bit of a pain, not all of the bubbles came out, especially around the ear speaker.  It feels kinda gummy to my fingers, which sucks because I use swype.  I guess it could be worse, which is why there are three stars.
B005450YHU	I never thought what a difference Zagg covers do versus the cheap imitation covers. I have bought those 5 for a dollar type screen covers and heck why keep buying when you can get one that last forever. I've had a Zagg cover for six months and guess what its good as new. I highly recommend this screen protector for all touch phones.
B005450YHU	After reading the reviews I decided to go to the store and let an expert insatll it.  Like many others, I have been through plenty of the 5 for $5 and they were a waste. Do yourself a favor and get it from a big box store and pay the extra $8 to have it professionaly installed
B005450YHU	We (my husband and I) have used several other/cheaper screen protectors in the past. None seem to work nearly as well as Zagg Invisible Shield! It fits perfectly with our Samsung Galaxy Prevails. We have owned ours for just over 2 months now, and there are absolutely no fingerprints, dirt, or oils (from skin), on them! Fingers slide very smoothly while using the touch screen as well. 5 stars!!
B005450YHU	My sister turned me onto the idea of giving ZAGG a try. She uses one for her kindle and phone, as does her fiance. I was skeptical until I saw hers. The shipping was very fast! It was also extremely easy to put on my phone. You do have to let it sit and dry for 12 to 24 hours but I just put it on my mine a few hours before bed and when I woke up it was good to go. Would def. recommend this product to anyone asking about a good quality screen protector for a good price!
B005450YHU	The protector was smaller than the screen surface area so it was very difficult for me to line up correctly. After several attempts I had an unacceptable amount of fingerprints on the adhesive side and ran out of solution. Ended up completely unusable.
B005450YHU	STILL WORKING AFTER ALMOST ONE YEAR ON IT, AND PLENTY OF MILEAGE. BE SURE THE SCREEN IS &#34;LABORATORY&#34; CLEAN.  OTHERWISE IT WILL LOOK LIKE A TJ WINDOW TINTING JOB
B005450YHU	This is a wonderful product. Worth the money. It is made to last - made the phone durable in a time where most things are easily replaced.
