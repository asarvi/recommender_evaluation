B00313WSAI	Received only one home charger and I was billed for 2. I disputed one of the charges. The one I received is working great.
B00313WSAI	Got this charger for my son. His original charger broke and has been without a phone for a few weeks now. Found it on Amazon for under $3 and WOW! Works great! Plugged right into his Samsung Solstice and charged it just fine.
B00313WSAI	I've had this charger for about a month. It works fine. The plug is a little awkward as it hits the plastic cover thing but not a real problem. The plug construction looks cheap but as long as you treat it nice it will probably last a while... and then you can get another one for 3 bucks..
B00313WSAI	This charger fits like it's made by Samsung and is well made.  If you're looking for an alternative at less price but Samsung quality, this is it.
B00313WSAI	I have ordered more than 3 because all of them break.  They are cheap.I have contacted you privately at least a month or more ago, and you never got back to me.
B00313WSAI	This is the perfect replacement charger for Samsung phone.  Had an older phone without a charger, and this worked perfectly.
B00313WSAI	End of cable fell apart after two days use.  Tossed it and forgot about it.  Too cheap to bother with an exchange.
B00313WSAI	My 12 year old daughter left her charger at the condo at the beach. I had no intentions in driving an hour each way to retrieve this charger. I also did not want to pay the AT&T retail rate for something that I knew I could find at a less expensive cost. I searched for the the replacement and found it easily here. I purchased the charger and had a 12 year old expecting to wait an additional week (the longest possible quoted delivery date)before it would be here. To her, and my very happy surprise it arrived after only 4 days as opposed to possibly 10. It works fine and my daughter is happy. Good Job!
B00313WSAI	The charger for my Samsung phone arrived in a timely manner and has performed flawlessly since.  If they could improve it at all, it would be to make the cord a little longer.
B00313WSAI	needed it for a old phone. works like it says and it was cheap. no complaints, what else can you ask for right.
B00313WSAI	charges phone awesomely and very durable. mint condition samsung is awesome too. long cord and such. its a charger yup
B00313WSAI	for some reason my son is forever breaking these chargers so i bought 2 so we would have a spare and its better than the ones ive gotten from sprint
B00313WSAI	Good charger, not name brand but definetly does what its supposed to do. Very satisfied with this product! Electrical cord is a little short, could be longer. It works well and thats what counts for me.
B00313WSAI	Nice beautyfull charger,good price and not expensive.Its meets my expectacions and one thing that a like is that comes whif a pilot light that let you know that is charging.I will recomend it to anyone that whant a good charger at a great price.Thankyou.
B00313WSAI	I would highly recommend this seller. Everything arrived as promised on time and in working order. I will definitely do business with this sell again. Thanks!
B00313WSAI	I have went through 4 chargers for my samsung solstice. This one seems (so far) to be the toughest one ive had. my only complaint is the cord is alittle short and im not a fan of the red light that shine while plugged in. other than that it does its job!
B00313WSAI	The charger arrived broken. It seems to charge but it is falling apart and the materials have a very low quality. Besides, the company will not replace the item, I need to return it and buy it again, which is not worth it. Don't buy this product if you want something that will last.
B00313WSAI	After losing my charger, I bought one at Target, which I promptly returned because it made a loud buzzing noise when it was plugged in. I ordered this one online for much cheaper, and it works great, is quiet, and is smaller than the Target one.
B00313WSAI	I was desperately searching for a charger for my phone and it has provided me relief. It is working fine.
B00313WSAI	It works, it charges, simply put, came on time if not faster then expected. Would Highly recommend to buy here,.
B00313WSAI	I bought 2 and one stopped working within 2 weeks of my purchase.  Thankful they were so cheaply priced.  Atleast I still have one that works, otherwise I would be even more upset with this purchase.
B00313WSAI	This charger is just what we wanted.  She had lost her charger so its just what she needed.Works perfect,
B0061OT424	This charger has a nice long cord.  At least 48&#34;.  It works well in any 120V outlet.  I ordered two, one for me and one for my wife.  We've only had them a little over a week, but we are very happy with them.
B0061OT424	This charger does a great job on my Samsung Stratosphere.  I bought the phone used and it came with a generic charger.  This one made by Samsung charges much faster and makes the battery stronger than the off-brand one.
B0061OT424	Charger came quickly.............when I opened it I was surprised to see that the cord was so short ( it was about 30 inches long.....Only).  It works fine just wish the cord was as long as the one I was replacing.
B0061OT424	I would give this product 5 stars if it actually worked, the price was good, shipping fast and the charger looks very heavy duty. Unfortunately it did not work at all in my or my Boyfriend's Stratospheres.
B0061OT424	I bought it because my son broke my wall connector.It worked great for my phone.I would recommend it to anyone who needs to replace a charger or just needs an extra charger.
B0061OT424	I bought it because my son broke my wall connector.It worked great for my phone.I would recommend it to anyone who needs to replace a charger or just needs an extra charger.
B0061OT424	I decided to get mfg chargers after buying sooooo many after market products only to have them stop working In a veryshort time. good buy!
B0061OT424	This charger works great; just as if it originally came with the phone.  Definitely a great value for the money.
B0061OT424	Same as other review, this charger did not work in my stratosphere. it also looked used and old. Waste of money and time. Don't bother.
B0061OT424	it charges faster than the original charger. thats a definite plus. I am glad I made the purchase. I recommend it
B0061OT424	Most work well. Some however do not work very well. But for what I paid, it is to be expected.
B006C7U0CS	Had to buy this charger since I lost mine on a trip in Vegas. Shipping time was fair. The USB is universal cable so it won't match the charge outlet perfectly. Seems to charge slower than the original charger but it still works.
B006C7U0CS	Fit my HTC amaze perfect and works great. Holds up to everyday uses with no problems. I would buy again when the time comes
B006C7U0CS	I've bought more than one of these to have around the house.  They all die and stop charging!  Unreal, don't waste your money.
B006C7U0CS	cable only worked for about a week. did not charge phone on timely manner.cable charged slower than other cables.
B006C7U0CS	Showed up and looked genuine and nice and said HTC on it and all.  Worked GREAT, as my old one had crapped out.  However, after about 2 months this one did as well.  It still charges, just SLOWLY... It is actually quicker to charge my phone using the same mini-usb cord and run it to my computer, which I thought was weird-seems like it would be quicker straight out of the wall.  So, maybe it was just a weak one, but worked great for a month or two, then died off.  No known damage to it, so not sure why.
B006C7U0CS	This was exactly what I was looking for & at a great price. I need a spare, in case, I loss it or leave it somewhere I can't get at it.
B006C7U0CS	I found it so handy to have extra cell phone chargers so I can leave one permanently in my office and kitchen.
B006C7U0CS	I am so excited I no longer have to charge my cell with my kindle fire charger....this charger is perfect and my phone is extremely happy.
B006C7U0CS	I got this charger in order to have available in more than one location and it is in the same shape as a new one from HTC phone box!
B007I799AU	I misplaced my original charger.  Other places wanted to offer another type if charger, which would mess up my.battery.  THIS charger met my expectations and at a GREAT price.
B007I799AU	The charger sent was for older phones with smaller batteries. It might work as others have said but it requires comparison. The original charger is 4.8 volts at 1 amp and this is 5 volts at 0.7 amp so this charger is likely to fail sooner.
B007I799AU	I bought a wall charger when I bought the LG Spectrum cell phone.  This wall chager worked as well as the charger I bought with the original purchase.  Both worked very well.
B007I799AU	I figured I'd give this oem supplier a try, for the price you really couldnt beat it and i was pleasantly surprised that it was what it said. I'm very pleased with the items, can't tell the difference between this item and my original.
B007I799AU	Was exactly what I wanted!!!! Exactly what I expected it to be and at an excellent price! Definitely would order again.
B007I799AU	And the reason is because I think I goofed by not confirming V and amps.  It looked exactly like what I needed, and even has LG on it (brand of my phone).  But it takes forever to charge my phone - much longer than the original charger. So I looked at the fine print on the &#34;body&#34; of both chargers and I see that the volt & amp numbers are slightly off.  But because the price was SO GOOD, I'm not going to return, it would cost as much to return.  So I will donate to Goodwill or something.  And I really like (and specifically looked for) the ability to disconnect for the USB connection so I can upload photos.  Very handy for travel!So the product itself is FINE.  The Amazon reseller was awesome as far as prompt service, product as described, etc.  Just word to the wise - read the print on your charger before you order another one.
B007I799AU	The charger would not work as describe.  We disposed of the charger as it would have cost more to return that we paid for it.
B007I799AU	It is just like the one that came with my LG Spectrum phone from Verizon and the price was good.
B007I799AU	This works just as good as the one from store. Nice to have an extra charger to keep for traveling when not home. Better price than can get found in any brick and mortar store!
B007I799AU	I needed a second LG wall/travel charger for my new phone and this is exactly what I needed! Great price too!
B007I799AU	This charger will replace the one that comes with your Android and is of completely equal quality. The only difference is that this is much more affordable. It just doesn't make sense to buy any other.
B007I799AU	Although it is not the original cord, it does do what its supposed to do.  Great to have extras in case you need one on the go!
