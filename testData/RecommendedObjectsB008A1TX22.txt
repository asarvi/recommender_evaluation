B000VC5CXW	not good does not fix right, doesn't stay one very good and very hard to get on in the 1st place
B000VC5CXW	liked that the product was shipped in as few items as possible. worked great on the phone
B000VC5CXW	So you know the screen is intended for Z3, noy for Z6. In order to fit it on a Z6 model, you will need use scissors to tailor a screen accordingly.
B000VC5CXW	There's a slight curving at the bottom, near the nav-wheel.  Bought two just to be safe, and both had same issue on two different Z3's.  I just cut it with a pair of scissors.  Works really well at keeping screen scratch free.
B000VC5CXW	This is a real good addtion to protect you phone.It fits perfectly on the original screen.Takes a little patience to squarely fit it to contours of screen but once on,it does it work nicely.Would buy again.RMG
B000VC5CXW	Overall it is a great item. It really works for keeping my screen from getting scratched.The only issue I found with it we discovered immediately, but it was VERY easy for me to solve. At the bottom of the screen on my ROKR is a "thumb bar" (the little bar you push with your thumb to lift the screen for access to the number pad). The thumb bar on the phone is almost twice as long as the opening provided on the protector. I've noticed that a lot of the products that claim to fit the Z6 ROKR have that problem (as well as the covers blocking the camera, side buttons and battery cover latches).This one is very easy to fix though: got an X-acto knife? If you don't, you can get one at Walmart cheap. You have to use an Xacto knife - no pocket or kitchen knives: the blades are too thick! A box knife might work too, as long as it's got a brand new blade.Align your protector with the rest of the screen and smooth out all of the bubbles. Now very carefully, using your xacto knife, cut around the base of the thumb bar at the bottom of the screen. Make sure you do this slowly so you do not accidentally slip and cut the screen. Also, do not apply too much pressure or you'll cut into the front of the phone itself.Just try to stay right on the shape of the bar. Then discard the piece cut off. Afterwards, just clean the screen with the cloth provided.It worked perfectly for me. Even with the tiny fixable defect, I still give this an A+!
B000VC5CXW	I got this item because im very clumsy and had already scratched my phone a few times. It's cheap so you can always get a new one if u do completely thrash it but its alot harder to replace your phone. It it wasn't too easy to see but it didn't become transparent. If you get a plastic case/cover thing you cnat tell at all. It did lift a bit in the corner after I tried to shift it.
B0013N16VU	I've had an iPhone for sometime, and originally had an Invisible Shield on it. I liked the Invisible shield, but there were a few goofy things about it.- It eventually yellowed (although using a UV wand I was able to help that to some extent)- It got lots of gunk stuck under it- There were "lips" on the sides that I kept hitting while using the phone- I DID get scratches on itThat being said, I ended up hearing about the Bodyguardz. Although Invisible Shield does offer a lifetime warranty, the Bodyguardz were said to cover more, come with more, and offer better clarity.Since I live in the same general area of their headquarters, I was able to go to the local mall and have them install it, which beats me having to handle it.Comparing the difference between the two shields, yes, it is everything the reviews said. It is easier to see through than the Invisible Shield. It does cover more (although I think that could be bad too, as there are more places for dirt to get stuck under), and really is a good product. It will be fun to test their warranty when, I'm sure, I need another.I've always been a purist, and prefer not to use bulky cases anyway. The Bodyguardz is a great product, offering everything that has been said. Get 4 shields (2 front, 2 back), the squeege, spray, lifetime warranty, better clarity, and scratch-proof protection. Definitely worth the investment.
B0013N16VU	I was getting this product and I read the instruction carefully then I apply the film to the phone which is not hard but you have to be very careful. The product work well and I love it. It last for like 6 months until it starts to come off. All in all, I like it a lot as I don't expect it to last very long anyway.
B0013N16VU	There are so many new gadgets and gizmos that have these great screens and smooth finishes and we need to protect them. I will admit I am a fingerprint phobic, I hate people touching my screen leaving finger prints and I totally dislike getting my new gadgets scratched. So when I saw the Bodyguardz I was pretty happy. The shield provides an invisible barrier against those things that go bump in your purse or pocket or from those dirty fingers when they touch your screen.The package contains 2 complete invisible protectors, the application solution, a squeegee card and the instructions. You can also view an instruction video on [...] The video shows them cleaning their iPhone with a Micro-Fiber Cleaning Cloth which is not included with the Bodyguardz it is sold separately.To start make sure your hands are thoroughly cleaned. Also make sure the iPhone is also clean use a lint free cloth to remove any dirt or dust that might be on the iPhone. I would say do a dry run of how all the pieces are going to fit and set them up on a clean surface. Don't try to rush this slow and easy will get it done correctly.Wet your hands with the solution and spray the sticky side of the film when you peel it off of the backing. Don't worry if you over spray you can't use too much solution if it feels overly moist wait a minute and it will dry out. DO NOT spray your device directly only spray your hands or the film. You can reposition the film as many times as you need until you have the film set in the correct position. If the corners are giving you a bit of a challenge take a deep breath and move onto the other part and come back to the corners after you have the other pieces where you want them to be.You may get some air bubbles when you lay the film on the device use the squeegee card to remove the bubbles. Start in the middle and work outward, don't press to hard on the film surface or you might scratch it or stretch it.Make sure to get all of the moisture out or a haze will slowly appear under the film giving it a foggy appearance. Don't panic the moisture should evaporate in about 24 hours after you have applied the film. Once you have left the film on the device for more than 10 minutes don't try to remove it you might leave fingerprints on the film which is what we were trying to avoid in the first place.The biggest thing with applying the Bodyguardz is patience. The invisible shield protects your device and you are able to access all of your buttons with ease and no worries about scratches or fingerprints.
B0013N16VU	Works great on the screen but was very difficult to apply to the rest of my iphone.  Also didn't last very long, except for the screen protection.
B0013N80KU	I ordered this from Bargain Cell through Amazon. They sent a cheap generic chineese made screen protector, not a fantastic Zagg invisibleSHIELD as advertised. When I called they said it was basically the same thing, but offered to give me a refund... not worth the trouble for five bucks. Just order it directly from Zagg.
B001BXY9P2	Expectable quality, easy application, nice look to the display afterwards. Nothing else to add, recommended.
B001GNGXJC	I tested the three on my T-mobile G1, but this review applies to all makes and models since they use the same material but just cut to different sizes to fit the phone.ZAGG invisibleSHIELD+ Extremely durable and scratch resistant+ I took a key trying to drive a hole through one of these sheets and was not able to+ If you screw up putting the screen on, it's fairly easy to remove w/out creasing the screen- A huge pain to put on, especially if you have to fit the skin around round contours- If you have a dark color phone, the body protector would make your phone look shiny looking cheap- Deal breaker for me: If you have a touch screen, the screen protector gave some resistance when finger swiping (scrolling down web pages) and dragging your finger along the screen. It had a rubber-ish feeling.Boxwave crystal+ Like the name says, crystal clear+ Fairly easy to put on- If you screw up putting the sheet on the first time (E.g. misaligned or a particle was caught beneath the sheet), it was difficult to peel the sheet off w/out creating a permanent fold/crease- Deal breaker for me: Although there was not  much resistance as the invisibleSHIELD (it did not have the rubber-ish feeling), there was still some resistance. After a couple uses w/ enough face/finger oils the resistance was gone. However, since I screwed up the first time putting it on which resulted in creasing the protective sheet while peeling it off, it gave me the opportunity to try out the Boxwave Anti-glare.Boxwave anti-glare+ Comparing to the Boxwave crystal, I was not able to tell the difference in visibility. I would say it was equally crystal clear.+ Easy to put on, now that I had practice from my screwup w/ the Boxwave Crystal+ Anti-glare as advertised- If you screw up, you've screwed up - as mentioned as a -'ve for the Boxwave Crystal as well+ The major deal winner: Least resistance. Comparing to the previous two, I'm extremely happy w/ the feel of this screen protector when swiping back and forth. I recommend this screen protector not only for protecting the screen of your phone, but also to make any screen easier to swipe. I'm not sure why Boxwave didn't include this feel for the Boxwave Crystal line, but this was definitely the selling point for me.hth,
B001GNGXJC	I was disatisfied to see I paid $16 for a piece of plastic film that I have to trim to fit my phone. For that price and since it was advertised for the G1 phone, I made the wrong assumption that is was a custom fit. I am returning it to BoxWave. I will update this critique on how they handle returns. My recommendation is to not order it. Oh also, they charge $3.40 for mailing when it came in an envelope with 62 cents postage.
B001GNGXJC	Buy the same brand screen protector for my Nexus One and the G1 version is nowhere near the quality.  The "ClearTouch" is not very clear, and is easily visible once applied.  It has an odd texture to it as well.. not smooth like the "crystal" version on my N1.  Will look at other brands when it's time to replace the G1's protection.
B001GNGXJC	product is pretty good... I think the clear would be a great product... but the anti-glare causes white light to separate a little on white backgrounds. I am going to get the clear ill review that when i get it... that is if boxwave will let me exchange it. if they dont i will be back to lower my star rating.
B001U60D32	It looks nice on my phone but in the sun its hard to see the screen . Works good for a mirror also ..
B001U60D32	Pros:  Easily applied, looks goodCons:  messes with the touchscreen's response dramatically. so much that i took them off soon after applications
B001U60D32	The screen protector was great, three for 3-cents, just the shipping.  I was buying a battery for my phone and just added this.  I hate the phone, it is a touch screen, dont buy the phone!!  you have to touch it just right
B001U60D32	Not worth it at all. The mirror is almost like a fun house type deal. When the backlight is on, it looks like a 3-D screen and gives me a headache every time I use my phone. The screen protector is also short on covering the entire screen. Also to add I never got a soft card that was suppose to be included.
B001U60D32	This is a great product except in the sun. When you are outside or even in your house, it is hard to see when there is light. It is pretty thick, so I really liked that. But I changed it because I was barely able to see anything during the day.
B001U60D32	If you buy this, I suggest changing the display to black. The slightly rainbow colors that go across the screen when the display is white hurts my eyes. I changed mine to black and now it is an awesome screen protector! It's really thick, too, so I'm not worried about scratches going through and getting the screen.
B001U60D32	the stickers aren't even the right size for the screen. They are about 1/4 of an inch short on each side and is not wide enough for the part where you hear out of. i was not pleased with what i got.
B001U60D32	..does the last sticker you pull off always leave so much residue...I went through all three with the same result.. And as usual wuth the price, its really not worth the trouble to send it back.. buyer beware
B001U60D32	Very nice, makes the phone look "high tech" good protection and privacy from prying eyes over your shoulder or beside you. Great product.
B001U60D32	You can't really see your screen when your in the sun. The screen protector is really scratched already! I don't think I am going to buy this product again
B001U60D32	The item arrived on time. Fairly easy to put it on. The protector does have a rainbow glare to it, but I got used to it.
B001U60D32	Awesome product, still got the first one on my sister's phone and she usually has long nails so it's bound to be scratched. Anyway, its long lasting and worth it!!!! Purchase it, oh and it acts like a mirror as well so have some fun with that when you need a mirror in times of need :P
B001U60D32	its reflects like a mirror and looks like it too, the only thing i dont like about it is that you cna see all the scratches easy, other than that its nice and tough to protect the screen
B002MZ8RII	The screen protector was advertised as a protector for the iPhone or iPOD Touch 3G. I was using for the iPOD Touch.  It did not fit exactly so had to be trimmed with a paper cutter.  Then I had a terrible time removing the pull off tabs used for the installation. The tabs were stuck on the protector so hard that I couldn't get them off with out using a glue remover.  The glue remover damaged the screen.  They sent 4 screens. I was able to use only one.  I would not recommend purchasing this item from this vendor.
B002MZ8RII	It was pretty hard to take away the bubbles. The secret is to have the surface extremly clean. It works just fine and really protects the surface. Dont regret buying it.
B002MZ8RII	I was looking for a screen protector that looks completely invisible since I love Iphone shinning, perfect touch screen and this is exactly that! you dont even notice that there's a protector on your iphone. In regards with the installation is not that easy and you have to be extremely careful to avoid air bubbles.
B002MZ8RII	I switched to my old one which I wish I hadnt torn off, now looking for a new cover.
B002MZ8RII	The old adage that you get what you pay for certainly applies here. I found them a bit more difficult to install than the original and more expensive iPhone brand. Then I discovered they scratched immediately. I'm not terribly happy with them and will not order them again.
B002MZ8RII	What a great cheap find!  I had ordered the so-called "mirrored" screen protector5-Pack Premium Reusable LCD Mirror Screen Protector with Lint Cleaning Cloth for Apple iPhone 3G 8GB 16GB / 3G S 16GB 32GB(read my review of that), but it was easy to scratch and didn't really give a mirrored effect - just a flat silvery look.  This screen protector is slightly thinner and goes on very easily.  I had no bubbles and unexpectedly, it had a real solid clean and clear mirror effect!  For the price, it can't be beat.  I'm going to buy several more just to hand out to friends.  Delivery was really fast as well!
B002MZ8RII	Easy to use and very handy. Ordered over the holidays and received very quickly. Thumbs up!!!
B004IN25A8	made my phone look very good and be save from scratches and stuff didnt interfere with sensors served me good great price also
B004IN25A8	Does act like a mirror (gets the job done)but, changes the color of the screen depending on the angle of phone to a greenish color. Doesn't cover the entire screen, and no hole for the sensor which makes it practically impossible to hangup during a call. I had to cut a hole myself where it was becoming such a problem. Hard to see outside.
B004IN25A8	It was great, fast shipping . But the only thing was that it did not have a hole for the sensor which can be effect your voice call multitasking.
B004IN25A8	I had recieced the protectors right in time, they are a little smaller than my screen but in all a good buy!
B004IN25A8	This is absolutely the best screen protector out there! I had to order another one for my boyfriends phone! I went into the MetroPCS store today to ask them for a clear hard case for my LG Optimus M Cell Phone and showed them my cell phone and the two girls behind the counter went nuts over it! they had me write down the website to get it themselves! I think you have done wonders to make my cell phone unique! Thank YOU so much!
B004IN25A8	Great price and very fast shipping.  The screen protector was easy to apply and no bubbles.  The only thing I do not like is outside during the day it's hard to see who's calling.  Other than that it does have a great mirror image.
B004IN25A8	This item came defective from the beginning,had the sensor hole on the opposite side. Contacted seller,they sent me a replacement and it was the same thing!!! We verified the phone and model were correct and according to them they checked all their stock and it was fine, making it seem I was a liar or crazy. I even sent them a picture. Anyway now I'm stuck with 2 worthless screen covers and didn't get my money back
B00574DP9M	I really needed an international phone. Quad band un-locked. Love Nokia. Thank youI could use the next edition when it comes out as well. Same specs.
B00574DP9M	Easy to fix on the phone, did not change the sharpness of the screen and the video actually protects the smartphone.
B005C2A4A2	Great and amazing product nothing can compare to it!!! I even put my keys next to my phone and is still as good as new I love it. I use it for my whole phone and is wonderful
B0060QHQ78	I've received the item on time, but a little disappointed the item is not exactly what I've expected. I thought the skin would made of other than paper type but it's a rather flimsy than I've expected....I did like flim cover for the phone...
B006GEQG3O	Exactly what I was looking for. They protect the screen and give it a nice matte finish cutting down on reflections. Easy to apply. I'm very happy with these.
