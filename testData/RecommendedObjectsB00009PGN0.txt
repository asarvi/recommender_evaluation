B0002VQ3SU	i recently got this phone and my first impression was...WoW..this is a very small phone..it has all the basic features you need in a cellphone. text messaging, voicemail, alarm clock...if your'e a minimalist or starter, and looking for a basic phone, then i recommend this one to you. So far, i am very pleased with this phone and it never drops my calls, and my signal is always on full strength. It has good battery life, that lasts up to few days, the interface is intuitive because Nokia's are known for making cellphones simple, and at a great price. Also, the phone came the day before the estimated arrival date. If your'e looking for a good site to buy a good phone, then your'e in the right place(Amazon). ;)
B0002VQ3SU	This is a very good cell phone and Amazon.com gives the best deal. But, you can't transfer your old phone number from different provider to Cingular through Amazon.com. If you transfer your old phone number, you won't get your mail-in rebate. Please read amazon.com mail-in rebate rules carefully!!!You can read about how to transfer your number through this link : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/508597/102-6686881-6992121
B0002VQ3SU	Why settle for less, or commit yourself to a specific cellular provider and service plan, when you can get a complimentary unlocked top of the line Motorola RAZR v3i cell phone that works with any cellular service provider and any SIM card. I got mine free at this web site:  ilikethis.info/razrv3i
B0002VQ3SU	A couple months ago, I had a Nokia 3120;however, I wanted to try something new.  So I purchased a Motorola v551.  At first I was happy I did so, but later I regreted it.  So, I went back to my lovely Nokia 3120, and it compares highly to the quality and fondness of the Motorola.  I absolutely love my Nokia 3120.  It has great reception, great image quality, great battery power, and a great design.  I have Cingular and I live in CA, and CA is renowned for it's bad reception and I still get wonderful reception.  It is also a very low price.I highly recommend this phone.
B0002VQ3SU	I've always owned a Nokia phone simply because it works for me(and I'm a creature of habit). =) If you could care less about owning a tricked out, camera flip-phone with all the bells and whistles, then this phone is for you. The one thing that really differs with this phone (compared to the three other Nokias I've had over the years) is that these buttons are really small and it can literally be a pain sometimes when you're sending text messages. After owning this phone for nearly a month now, here's what I've summarized:Pro's:* It's inexpensive* Nice, color display screen* Has a useful voice recorder* Speakerphone is very useful (esp. if you're driving and don't  own a headset)* You can change your right, navigation button to create faster shortcuts* Somewhat user-friendly for those that are cell phone challenged* Comes with a sleek travel size charger* If you're a Cingular customer, this got better reviews compared to the fancy-shmancy (and more expensive) Samsung, LG and Ericcson phones they also offer.Con's:* Teeny, tiny key pad* Ring volume has a big difference between levels 2 and 3* If you own a headset for older Nokia phones you have (such as a 3595), it won't work with this one. You'll have to splurge and buy a new headset. =(* Ring tones are kind of weak, I'm 30 and it feels like they had teens in mind when creating ringtones for this phone (same thing with the wallpaper options).* Games are cool, but the bowling game is only limited to +/- 5 games before you're denied access.Hope this was useful for anyone interesed in buying this phone. =)
B0002VQ3SU	First this is a beautiful phone with a beautiful size and a beautiful feature-set targeted for a busy biz type. Features are tri-band for reception, Dictaphone for voice memos, Speakerphone for hands free, and PDA features for; contacts w/address, calendar for todo and event alarms with day/wk/mo/yr repeatability on recurring events like weekly meetings, birthdays, take out the trash :), etc.ALL the features work great. Plenty loud receiver, ringers, vibrator, and speakerphone, all adjustable. Has a separate power switch on top for quick access to ringer options(one press) or power-off(press and hold)for batt save, etc.It is so small you can wear it in the watch pocket of jeans, in a shirt pocket, or your pants pocket without a bulge. Still, the keypad layout is such that I find it easy to dial because the keys cover the total keyboard, unlike my previous SE T234 small point buttons. For those who derated this phone for its small size, I don't get it? If you want a bigger phone that has bigger keys and a bigger screen, get one for heaven sake. Please rate a phone for its features and performance, not its size. That is a positive for those who want this.Those looking for a well featured small phone with Nokia's quality and RF reception, you will not be disappointed with this one. You will not get a camera, radio, mp3 player, tv size screen, or memory enough for gobs of games, ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers and video(this is the Nokia 6230i). You will get an excellent and practical communication and organizational device having enough memory for adequate games/ audio/video accessories and the features required for the practical user, and a good price.Pros: Power/Ringer quick access button, loud but adjustable receiver, powerful vibrator and flashing keyboard silent modes, small and VERY stylish, dictaphone, speakerphone, user definable Shortcut/Goto list, Org Calendar/Calc/Stopwatch/Countdown/Alarm, Nokia RF reception, PC sync with Nokia's free down-loadable SW. Standard barrel-type charger plug.Cons: Non-standard headphone jack, no side button volume control, non-customizable navigation keys.
B0002VQ3SU	I have been a longtime Nokia supporter, and love that they sell simple, easy-to-navigate phones that pick up great reception. However, I returned this phone after one day of use because:- the sound quality was not good: static was present in the background of all of my calls.- when I put the phone near any speaker,  the phone caused the speakers to make very disruptive bleeping noises. This included my car stereo and my speakerphone at work.
B0002VQ3SU	I've had mine for over a year now, so I thought I'd offer some comments.First, buy a case.  This is not a particularly tough phone.  My teenage son killed his within six months.  Then again, he was always tossing it around and dropping it.  I've dropped mine too, but the case has kept it looking good.This is a small phone.  If you've got big fingers as I do, it may give you some difficulty.  I wouldn't buy a smaller phone, but this one fits nicely about anywhere.The display is quite bright once you get the settings right.  Perversely, the display is best with the wallpaper off and the brightness "down."  When you turn it up, it just washes the text out.The alarm clock is fine, and the aftermarket accessories available for interfacing with a PC work well enough with a little fiddling.  I've loaded my own MIDI files as ringtones.  Not all of them load correctly, so you'll have to experiment with that.The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful from the user end, but the person you're talking to seems to hear you well enough.All in all, a decent - but not outstanding - phone.  I've looked at others but, for now, have stayed with my little Nokia.
B0002VQ3SU	I recently subscribed to a two year Cingular service. At first I purchased a Motorola V551, but that gave me poor reception compared with my Samsung E315, which I previously owned. Not wanting an expensive phone that would drop calls frequently, I decided to trade it in for a Nokia, becasue my father used Nokia ever since he started to use cellular services, and he was extremely satisfied. The Nokia 3120 appealed to me because of it's styling. Although it is not as technologically advanced as the phones I was used to, the styling appealied to me, along with the fact that the phone was 39.99. I truly like the styling. It is the best I've seen in the bar phone class. It is not outlandish in any essence. It is a smart phone for people who want basic functionality. What also appeals to me is the user interface. It is the best one I've seen for any phone. It is the smae interface used on all digital nokias, which date back to about 1996, which is when I first was exposed to Nokias. It is extremely simple to use, the most convinient features can be accessed with two or three button pushes. The biggest thing that got me to purchase this phone is it's reception. Better than any phone i've used. I can use it deep inside buildings. My mother has a Nokia 6010, and she can call from the breakroom in her office, which is in the center of the building. All this packed in a sleek, understated enclosure makes this phone very pleaseing.My only complaints about this phone is the lack of "fun" features, such as a camera or video playback. If you really want a camera phone, but like what you hear abou this Nokia, the 6230 is for you, and I will buy that in 6-12 months. Another thing I do not like is the color. You can get covers for it, but the middle part of the phone, where all the circuitry and the antenna lie, is pasty white, which for a guy like me, is girly. One of my friends commented exactly. One flaw, though it does not bother me, is the size of the phone. While it is higly portable and compact, the buttons could be too small for some.A summary of pros and cons (some i did not list above)ProsStyling and portabilityUser interfaceReceptionBright DisplaySpeaker phoneNokia dependabilityConsColor choicesize of keypadlack of "fun" features such as camera, although it has a camera attackmentI know this review is very long, but I wanted to cover all aspects of the phone so as not appear bisaed in any direction.

B0002VQ3SU	This is a decent phone ive had it about a year now this is my first phone and i am 16. Its somewhat stylish i guess ive seen a couple people with it is a very good basic call phone and texting. other features include internet which is expensive and kinda worthless. The only thing i can complain about is about 9 onths in i was at my computer doing some school work i placed it near the speaker and a friend called it made a reall loud staticy noise (my speakers were up pretty loud so that could of contributed to it)it was actually starteling and made me jump up and turn off the computer. about a weak later i put it on my tv entering my room layed down and another friend called and it did it again not as loud but still pretty annoying. Anyway its not like the world will end but you might get startled once in awhile.
B0002VQ3SU	This cell phone is for people who want an updated phone in mobile technology, and of course to talk and call people. The features are great, and this sleek cell phone will fit almost everywhere. Color screen and a voice recorder, you'll find something that you'll like!
B0002VQ3SU	I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, because I wanted a simple phone that is light, tri-band, and with a decent battery (up to 2 weeks standby time nowadays is quite reasonable).The battery in standby didn't last more than 3 days, and if you turn off the phone to recharge the battery, the screen becomes totally dark: it is then impossible to know whether the phone is recharging, or whether it became fully charged, which I've never seen with the other Nokia phones!If these characterstics are generic, then get rid of it A.S.A.P.!!!!
B0002VQ3SU	I'm not going to bore you with the many features that this particular phone has since its user's guide is online at Nokia. My complaint is about how small the numbers (4,6,7,9) are. To dial a number one has to actually use both hands since using one hand can lead to mistakenly dial the intended number. I don't have large hands at all and have found this problem to be very cumbersome to overcome with one hand. One user also complained about the screen going blank when recharging. I agree with him. This happens only if the phone is off but the user is left wondering whether the phone is charging or completely charged. I don't know of any phone that blanks out when charging.-AC
B0002VQ3SU	At first glance I fell in love with the phone - the small design, the chrome plated front, all my friends just love it, thinking its another high-priced, fancy phone from nokia/cingular, when surprisingly it was very affordable, but I must admit - it IS fancy, yet extremely "phone newbie" friendly.It has everything you want and need plus more. It has text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, to download many more ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else you may want or need for your nokia 3120, can be found on media net. It's the internet on your phone, letting you download practically anything you may want, including java apps. If youre at work, the movies, or dont feel like calling anyone, you can go ahead and use your instant message feature, by logging onto AIM or YAHOO to chat with your buddies. There are many more features to this phone - like any screensaver you could want, you can even record your own voice or music to use as a ringtone.Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar with 500 entries.Cant get up in the morning? Alarm clock.Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown.Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported.You can talk for 6 hours if you like on this phone, or you can go ahead and leave it on your desk for over 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, and still be able to talk. Total standby time is 17 days.The call quality is great, except if you put the the phone too close to a stereo or your speakers, it makes the speakers beep, which is the only downside, but is totally negligable.I'd give this phone 4/5 stars, because of all the features you can have on a phone that's 4.01 inches long x 1.68 inches wide x 0.76 inch thick, and weighs just about 3 ounces.
B0002VQ3SU	this was my first cell phone and i loved it. i owned it for about two years. it's perfect for a newcomer...cute style mixed with easy to use features.
B0002VQ3SU	I've had this phone since October. I got it because it was so small and adorable. At first I was happy with it...but once I actually started using it, that all changed. Good news first..PROS:-Loud volume-Easy to use-Lots of included ringtones..some are cute, some are a little out there-Voice recorderCONS:-CONSTANTLY drops calls-Recieves text messages HOURS after people send them-VERY small text messages--160 characters...most phones have over 800-The buttons make a very loud clicking noise sometimes so you have to shut off the phone for a few minutes-Bad battery life..if you send a few messages a day and talk on the phone for a few minutes, you're gonna have to charge it all night-You can't have real music tones-Voice recorder can't be your ringtone-Very bad speaker interference..I have to keep it a few feet away from the computer/tv and anything else with speakersI wish more people would have said bad things about this phone before I bought it! Stay away from this phone if possible..
B0006JLJM8	I have had this phone for almost 2 months and I'm very unhappy with it.  The battery life is horrible.  I have to charge the phone at least once a day and I barely use it.  Just leaving it on seems to suck the battery life right out of it.  There is an extended life battery available but it only adds another hour.  Besides the very short battery life, the phone gets so hot after 3 minutes of talking on it.  It's almost too hot to hold.  The camera isn't great either and I definitely wouldn't recommend this phone if you're going to take a lot of photos.  The quality is poor and if you don't hold perfectly still you will get a blurry photo.  I wish I never bought this phone.
B0006JLJM8	First, let me say this phone itself is great. I'm not sorry about the phone itself, but I wish the carrier was somebody other than Sprint.My stint with Sprint hasn't been the worst I can imagine, but that's about the best I can say for it. Since having this phone, I've lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Boise, Idaho, and Redmond, Washington. I haven't gotten a good signal in any of these places, and it hasn't been uncommon for the phone to switch to another network entirely, costing me roaming charges to use it. Today at work it did that, and the roaming signal was a better and clearer signal than I've *ever* gotten on the actual Sprint network. I was a Nextel customer before and it was slightly better; now that the companies are merged, I'm going to steer clear of both of them. My contract ends in March, and I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to jump ship to a better provider.So that's really my main gripe. A second is that as a software developer, Sprint's developer support is terrible--I've been wanting to play around with apps using the phone's built in GPS support, but Sprint has made it nearly (if not totally) impossible for most developers to get access to the necessary API.Otherwise, I guess Sprint has been ok. Anytime I've had a question or problem I've submitted it through their website and always gotten a quick, informed, and satisfactory reply. That's about the only thing I've been happy with, other than the phone itself, which has been pretty nice. It would be nicer if Sprint actually bothered to improve the web services/applications they provide, which suck. I gave up on any Sprint-provided web stuff long ago, and just use Google on my phone for anything I need. Why should I need to go through 5 menus to check the status of a flight or find a restaurant? I don't know what people at Sprint work on--I haven't seen any improvements in anything from them in the year I've had the phone. The network is no better, web stuff is no better, and to top it off I pay *more* than I did with Nextel, which was supposed to be the 'expensive' carrier. Lousy--these clowns have lost my business forever.
B0006JLJM8	The first thing I definitely noticed with this phone is that it gets really hot when I use it.I didn't expect the camera to be great, and so it wasn't a big surprise that it wasn't.The phone is really hard to use. Using almost any feature is really difficult, because trying to find it through the menus takes forever. Just setting up a certain ring for a person is hard.The name dial feature is nice and works fairly well. You can call a person by saying their name without having to record it first. The only problem is that's it's also badly designed. To use it you have to hold down the Talk button for about 2 seconds, wait for the logo screen to appear and disappear, then you have to say Name Dial, then finally the name, so that it takes at least 8-10 seconds. If it doesn't recognize what you say, you have to repeat the process.The contacts menu is also badly organized. I got spoiled by a nice Kyocera phone that let me just type in the person's name from the main screen and it would find it from there. To do that with this phone you have to go to the contacts screen and type in the name, or remember whatever speed dial number the person randomly ended up with (it's based on the order you put them in).Anyway, it's a mess trying to use the phone. It works well enough for me when talking to people, except that the phone really does pretty hot after only a few minutes of talking.
B0006JLJM8	I agree with just about everything that the previous reviews have said about the features. One thing I really like on Sprint with this phone is you can very easily send SMS or E-mail directly from a menu without going through a web page (which takes like several minutes). Very useful tool!The only issue I have with the phone is the sound quality. On some calls it seems perfect on others, especially with other Sprint phones, the A740 seems to "clip" the sound and you get a noticable sound as if someone was switching on and off a mute button. I returned one phone that had this problem and got another which seems to do it less but still does it. I have an older LG phone and tried them side by side and the LG has none of these problems on identical calls in identical places - it also seems like the problem is worse when the battery is not at 100% charge. I took the phone to a local SprintPCS retail center and they tested it ok and told me that "nobody else is returning theirs". If you have one of these and notice anything, maybe you could send me an e-mail at leifer "at" delcoms.com
B0006JLJM8	I got this phone in March, haven't had much trouble with it. I like it for the most part, only a few things i don't like.1. The battery life is pretty short, especially if you use vision often.2. No zoom on the camera, and the pictures come out pretty blurry unless you have a VERY steady hand.3. No speakerphone.4. I know this seems small, but the keys click pretty darn loudly. Not a great thing if you're trying to text in class.
B0006JLJM8	great featuresconservative and durablelooks pretty coolgood mfggreat basic features
B0006JLJM8	About 2 years ago, it was mother's day and there was a sale at Sprint.... Well, my dad, sister and I went to Sprint and bought two Samsung Phones (these ones)-buy one get one free.Mothers day past, and my mom now owned a cell again, and my dad, sister and I owned one of our own (we shared)We all love it, it:-has a bright, clear screen-has service almost all the time-battery lasts a long time-has voice commands-phone book holds a lot, and has own ring, name and picture for each person-countdown-alarm-ringer is loud and has "high+vibrate"-personal calender-etcThe problems are:-Certain features cost extra-personal calender holds limited dates-when using by your face, can get hot
B0006JLJM8	I got this phone and have really enjoyed it. As I read in some other reviews about complaning about the menu. All you have to do is change that in settings, not a problem. The picture phone is great and the flash works well. This phone has about everything including Vision (web) the only thing it is missing is a speakerphone. I was deciding over this phone or the Sanyo one that is popular but chose this one because I didnt really like the Sanyo. I have had it about 5 months and it still works fine. The battery also lasts long. Good Choice!
B0006JLJM8	i've had the phone for 2 weeks now and everything is great.  the phone has a very solid feel; feels well constructed.  i get reception everywhere, usually at least 2 bars (out of 4).  clarity and volume are great.  the camera is fun to have, but it's more of a novelty than anything.  the external display is also very nice to have, especially in full color.  the screen has a nice resolution and brightness.  built in ringtone selection is very large, including both traditional rings and musical ones.  the navigation is very easy.  managing your contacts is also simple, and being able to assign different ringtones to different groups is also nice.  in response to the other review, you can change the main menu from pictorial to a list.  battery life is okay, but this is my first phone, so i can't make a great comparison.  very sleek, it will definitely make your friends jealous.  amazon ought to add a picture to the site :)  lots of stuff not in the manual that you can do.  great features, usability, look, and quality.  great phone.
B0006JLJM8	I had the phone for 14 days before I returned it!-Call quality was terrible-Signal strength was poor in areas where I had great signal withthe previous phone-The phone heated up on the menu button during calls over 5 minutes.  It got so hot that it was actually uncomfortable to hold it to your face--not hot enough to burn, but still not pleasant!-Camera funcions were hard to use and slowSpend a few more dollars and buy a different phone!
B0006JLJM8	I purchased this phone last weekend and have been quite happy with it, so far.  By no means am I a technical expert when it comes to cell phones (so this review may be a bit lacking) but everything seems great.Usability:The menus are easy to navigate.  The first change I'd make on the phone is to pick a new format for the menu.  I'd view the menu in a list format.  The default is set to show the little picture icons.  It's a little hard to tell what each small icon is.  The small size of the navigation arrows are a bit frusterating, but something I've already gotten use to.Reception:The reception seems fine.  I'm able to get decent reception (at least 2 bars when the antenna is down.)  Most areas are either 3 or 4 bars.  My old phone was a Sanyo 4900 and I notice the same type of call quality.Volume:Ringer volume and earpiece volume are both good.Camera:This is my first camera phone, it works well.  Don't plan on using the camera a whole lot, but of course, it's great to have.Overall Quality:This is the area that I really look for in a purchase like this.  I have yet to find an aspect of this phone that does not seem well built or that worries me about breaking in the future.  Okay, maybe the antenna is a bit flimsy when extended, but I'm not concerned.  There is nothing on this phone that screams, "Break me."  That's a good thing!As I said, this phone has been very good so far.  I recommend it.
B0006JLJM8	I have always had Samsung phones. I made a switch back in September of 2004 to a Sanyo 8200. It had the speakerphone and so many features plus everybody told me how great the Sanyo phones are compared to all the other offerings from Sprint PCS. Well, I just returned the 8200 last weekend. It was the biggest piece of garbage phone I've ever used. To start, the audio was terrible on calls. But anyway, enough about the Sanyo.The Samsung PM 740 is a great little phone. I wanted a small phone that had not only a bright screen but also a brightly lit up keyboard. This phone is one of the brightest lit up keypads I've ever had. I used to have a Samsung A 500 a couple of years ago. It was a great phone. Also small. The 740 is smaller. I would agree with the other reviewer tht the menu screen should be changed from icons to a list as it is hard to tell what the pictures represent. Audio quality is top notch...very loud on calls. The ringer could be a little louder...at full volume up, the ringer is a little weak...not a huge deal as it does have vibration alert too. The battery that comes standard is OK but I know already that a longer life battery is a purchase I will soon make as they really do extend life between charges. It's construction seems like it will last without any problems. One thing I like about the Samsung phones much better than the Sanyo phnes is that if you want to call somebody that either called you or you dialed within the last 20 calls, all you have to do is push talk and scan up or down a few numbers and push OK or talk to dial. On the Sanyo, you have to navigate to the call log, then search for outgoing or incoming, then navigate up or down, and it is just a lot more pushing of buttons which can be a nuisance when driving. Also, this is the first phone that I remember from Samsung that has finally placed the "OK" button in the middle of phone keypad where it belongs, instead of on the left side which was hard to get used to. I would reccomend this phone to anyone who is looking for a very small and lightweight phone that also has a quality feel to it. Love the really, really brightly lit keypad!!!
B0007Q3TNC	Great Phone no doubt about it.I was looking for a nice decent small size phone from verizon for a long time.I had verizon for a long time and was pleased with its service, however i had hard time finding "cool" phone, the LG-7000 and 8000 looked too bulky.then at the verizon store i looked at this Audivox, i never heard of Audivox before the phone looked perfect in the first place but i was a little hesitant.Finally with 14 day money back gurantee i decided to buy this phone. Since then i have been in love with this phone.Pros:1. Great Audio Quality, my brother later told me that Audiovox makes speakers, no wonder it sounds crystal clear.2. Reception quality is great, never droped a single call, and i really mean it.3.Phone got several useful features like setting alarm up for any day in the year, three alarms, world time, stop watch, calculator.4. MP3 player is superb !!. It sounds like a real MP3 player just use the head phone provided with this phone, not to functional, i.e chosing songs, random songs etc. but hey this is phone not MP3 player5. Great battery life, i use my MP3 player for two hours a day and still has to charge my phone every other dayCons:1. Camera quality is Ok not great, it takes pics but not as good as u expect from 1.3 MP2. You cannot transfer images or tones from your computer to the phone or from phone to the computer using Mini SD card. which really sucks !!!Other then that great phone, i am enjoying it hope u will too.
B0007Q3TNC	At first, when I was switching over from a basic cell phone, I didn't know if I wanted one that was going to have so many features to it. But after getting this phone, I love it and I barely ever have any trouble with it. It has frozen up on me a couple times, but I have had it for almost a year now and it really has only been a couple times. But overall, it has been great! I love the mp3 feature.The only things I do not like is the quality of the camera; the pictures and the videos aren't really all that great, but I don't take that many anyways. I wish you could individualize pictures with people, but they do not pop up on the outside screen. You can individualize ringtones, unlike someone previously said. I wish that you could transfer all file types through the mini sd card but at least you can transfer mp3's. And yeah, I wish you could put your own image on the outside screen of the phone too.But apart from the drawbacks, everything on the phone works well, it has a lot of features, the screens are clear, and putting your own pictures on them, they look really nice too. My phone has never dropped a single call, I can set my alarm on it for any day, and I just love it.
B0007Q3TNC	I tried out the 3 new Verizon V Cast phones, and this one was the best of the 3. Everything it does, it does pretty well. I didn't give it 5 stars because the camera takes mediocre pictures, and the battery life is ok, but not great.
B0007Q3TNC	I'm on my 2nd model, soon to be 3rd. The phone is terrible. It freezes up, regardless of what I am doing(sending a text message, trying to view a pic, etc). I can just imagine what would happen if I used it as a mp3 player. Stay away from this phone.Just somethings for people to know: This phone does not have picture caller ID, you cannot give individual ring tones to people, nor can you put wallpaper on the outside screen. Wish I had known these things.
B0007Q3TNC	I've had this phone and verizon for a week.Pro:Very sharp screens, Good battery life, Good reception.Cons: Speaker phone is useless.VCast isn't available yet in my area.
B001O0EGD2	I was very excited to get this phone at first. Here are some problems:-The phone requires a data plan to activate. It needs to connect to gmail to sync. If the phone is unlocked, you still need a data plan, no matter where in the world you are and it stilled need to connect to gmail to sync. You can't sync or activation via wifi. The wifi menu is not available until it's activated.-The Camera is 3MP but very poor in quality when compared to the current Ericsson, Blackberry and Nokia models. No flash of any kind. Poor quality low-light pictures. Takes alright ones in the sunlight.-It's thicker than a iphone. You can't carry it in your pocket.-No headphone jack, just a small usb one. Requires expensive headphones.-Doesn't feel solid. Feels really fragile, one drop or spill and your expensive phone is gone forever.
B001O0EGD2	I was stuck between the G1 and the iPhone and the G1 won in the end for a couple of reasons: full keyboard, more sturdy; software, hardware, and applications are not proprietary, costs less; T-Mobile has better service, better plans, and better connectivity than AT&T, and the OS is so easy to use (never had to open a manual bc everything works the way you think it will).  The full browser is amazing, nothing like all the Blackberries and the connection is pretty fast.  I use the email notifications hourly as it helps me keep in touch with my business and WikiTap is an indispensable tool if you do any kind of research (pulls up articles VERY fast).  Only complaints are that the speakerphone quality is not the greatest, the camera could be a tad better, and the battery life is pretty crappy (though you have to consider that the phone is basically a mini-laptop).
B001O0EGD2	The Battery in my old phone died; I was eligible for an upgrade. I was holding off on upgrading until the G2 was released in May but I called T-mobile and here is what they did:Instead of replacing the battery in my Motorola Rizr, they offered me a free device to hold me over until I wanted to use my upgrade for the G2. So not only did I get a free G1, they also let me keep my upgrade so that when the G2 is released, I get to use my upgrade for that. hahah how great is that? On top of that, I asked them if I needed to return the G1 when I got my G2. She said no and that I could keep it. This is why T-mobile is awesome. Seniority with them takes you a long way.ok onto the device.....(There aren't many bad things to say about it so I'll get those out first)THE CONS-No video camera?Eh? I could be wrong but I cant find it.How can Youtube be a feature of the phone, but the phone NOT have a video camera to record movies? Just seems silly to me.-A little bulkyBut not too bad like I was thinking (I think this is because of the keyboard which the G2 will not have btw)-Camera not so goodOnly 3 megapixels? C'mon now! We can do better than that.PROS(Theres actually so many I can only highlight a few)-Youtube & Google Features are greatThey are pretty much the only websites i ever use on my computer at home anyways. Having them "specially featured" on my handheld makes me a happy camper.-The Android MarketBrilliant. absolutely amazing concept. Endless applications. Anyone can put something on the market so there is also junk to weed through! Which is expected. But I personally like the liberal approach to it. This place pretty much lets you create/upload/share all kinds of cool programs for your device. This "transormability" or personalization technique is what makes the Android network so great. It allows you to turn your device into the handheld of your dreams. How can you wrong with unlimited options? that means endless options for your phone. Not any one person's G1 is like anyone others. That idea is just amazing.-Love the touch screen/phsical keyboard optionThis is awesome that you have that option. I have to have a keyboard but at the same time, there are times when touchscreen is more practical. So bravo to them for giving us both options.-EXTREMELY User Friendly: I'm THAT guy that reads the instruction book front to back. Not with the G1. I was actively surfing the net, emailing, watching videos, and texting probably within minutes the battery was fully charged. Which is another good thing. This thing gives you a percentage bar on the front and it charges very quick!- Battery Life A+A fully charged battery will last 12 hours if your using the phone NON-STOP (this includes using internet, emailing, texting, talking, camera) Thats pretty impressive if you ask me. How do I know? I actually put the phone to the test!- Sync'ing capabilitiesYou can connect this thing to just about anything! I love how you can connect to your own wireless connection in your house. Makes surfing the web even faster than the phone naturally can!Youtube and google are dominating the web. They are now dominating the cell phone world. This is an A+ device. I rarely use my PC now. No need. I'm extremely critical over my gadgets too btw but this device is flat out awesome.
B001O0EGD2	I REALLY LOVED THIS phone...the apps, email, internet, even the text messaging layout is soooooo awesome.  The one problem I have with this phone is that I've had it replaced already and it hadn't even been a year.  It has a problem with shutting off by itself.  I don't get calls sometimes even tho i have a decent battery life and signal.  Also, my calls will just drop and not because of signal because the phone freezes up or shuts off by itself.  This is a constant frustration with this phone.  I love everything about it except for this major problem.  :-(  I've had a couple friends who also have this phone and they've had to replace it a couple times.  I'm seriously considering going back to a normal phone even though I know I will suffer from serious withdrawel from all the awesome features...but I just can't deal with this constant shutting off and having people call me 20 times even though it says I haven't received a call but they are getting frustrated by not getting through to me.  Sorry, can't deal with it anymore. OMG  no joke, my phone just restarted itself.  GRRRRRR
B001O0EGD2	This phone combines multi-media features, a touch screen, and constant internet connection with a phone that actually works really well! My other smart phones had poor reception, and poor to really bad voice quality. I also love the openness of the platform, and while it is just the first of the Android family of devices, a lot of cool free applications are available already. The maps integration is really nice and the GPS seems to be much faster to fix your location than other devices I have had (including dedicated GPS devices).The built in MP3 store is good for Amazon users, and doesn't tie your purchases to the device with DRM like iTunes does. My only warning is that like most HTC phones, using headphones requires an tiny adapter.
B001O0EGD2	first off,let me say that i was gonna get the new sidekick because now it has the video feature. but i wanted a touchscreen phone. so i got the g1. im so happt that i got this phone. yes the camera might be kinda crappy, actualy this is the downfall to the phone. my fave thing on the phone is youtube. i have to have my Kylie Minogue vids on hand. the video player is excellent. the other complaint next to the camera, is the speakerphone, but i dont use the speakerphone so it doesnt matter.overall im extremely happy that i got tis phone. you wont be dissapointed if you get this phone
B001O0EGD2	ok so if i order this phone right now will it be new or used?
B001O0EGD2	The phone came in a timely manner it was great for a replacement device  but since the phone is a older phone it was like using a flip phone for internet so i sold it after a month of usage.
B001O0EGD2	I'm not sure why the average review for this phone is 3.5 stars.I would give it 5!!  I used to be a Blackberry user and I won't go back unless T-Mobile eliminates the full, slide out qwerty keyboard on the next version of this phone, which I have heard they are going to do.Pros:BROWSER!  Awesome, quick, faster than my friends' blackberry 8900 when performing the same search.Touchscreen.  I had a Samsung Behold for two days before I returned it and went for the G1.  The G1 screen is SO much more responsive and so easy to use.Scroll Ball.  SOOOO much better than my Curve's scroll bar.  And it doesn't get dirty so easily.Notification bar.  I love this feature--it's a great place for consolidated information on what you missed while in a meeting, etc.Speakerphone.  This is great, compared to other phones I've had.Android Market.  Super easy.Gmail.  This makes keeping my calendar, email and address book together SO easy.Cons: It's a little large, but I guess that's needed as it's the first model of this phone and is pretty much a small computer.The camera sucks, but I only need it for basic picture taking.  I have a digital camera for taking quality pictures, so this doesn't bother me.Battery life--a LOT of people have complained about this, but I regularly get two whole days out of it before it needs to charge.  I just keep the 3g turned off unless I know I'm in a 3g area (I don't live in one) and this seems to keep the battery life up.I definitely recommend this phone!  It's made on the go searches and emails SO easy.
B004CLY8TC	Hello good evening the presente is to ask for information him to near the mobile BlackBerry Bold 9780 Phone (T-Mobile) and if it serves me in my country Venezuela and that type of technology uses, is to have a better information before choosing for the purchase Thank you in advance and being grateful for all his help
B004CLY8TC	I did the iPhone 3G & 3GS. I did the Motorola Droid. I came back to the smartphone that started it all.my (AT&T;)iPhone randomly dropped calls. My (Verizon)Droid randomly deleted email accounts. Both featured poor phonecall voice quality: The Droid's voice quality was acceptable in the sticks, but horrible where I live & work (downtown Chicago). The iPhone was horrible everywhere. Battery life was dreadful for both.Frustrated with it all, I came back to the Blackberry; the first smart phone I ever owned (courtesy of my employer at the time).It just works and works well. My iPhone/Droid could barely make a phonecall from my office. My 9780 can make phonecalls from within its elevator. My Blackberry's battery lasts days whereas my Droid & iPhone could barely make it through a single work day.Most people have no clue that I am on a cell phone until I tell them so. I don't know if this is a credit to the Blackberry or T-Mobile but, needless to say, I've found my ideal phone & service provider combo for the next two years.-Battery life is incredible and it charges quite rapidly-The new Blackberry OS is snappy and attractive and very configurable-Accessories are far cheaper than those for iPhone/Droid-light, thin and small. Perfect for your front pocket, but comes with an attractive holster also.-Love the all black body. Not a huge fan of the fancy trim found on other phones.NOTE: I also accidentally dropped it in a cup of hot tea (full submersed) the first week I owned it. Amazingly, after pulling the battery and allowing the liquid to drain, it still worked, albeit with a finicky touchpad and a screen that blinked at random times. I let it dry completely for 4 hours and everything was as good as new afterwards.
B004CLY8TC	this probably the best, and the most expensive phone I've ever owned. I've had a few other phones for T-mobile, (sidekick, samsung comback and smiley, and gravity, and two nokia music xepress phones) but The blackberry beats em all.Im a first time user, and I gave to say that I love it so far. The new OS that come with it is fast, (faster than my bros BB, which carries the previous OS), the qwerty keeyboard is nice and easy to type with. THe 5 MP camera/ video recorder is awesome too. And the screen... nice a crisp!It also come with a few other perks, an mp3 player, email, IM messenger, social apps and many other cool apps I can't even get into detail with. BUY THIS PHONE! YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!
B004CLY8TC	I was a long time T-Mobile customer, and then was wooed by the iPhone4 and AT&T.;  After a year of frustration over typing on a touchscreen (maddening) and a total dead zone at work, I paid up an early termination fee and bought this T-Mobile Blackberry.Like other reviewers stated, the phone works and works well.The little keyboard is FANTASTIC!  So much easier to type quickly and accurately as compared to a touchscreen keyboard.I get 5 bars of service at my desk, where AT&T; could only manage "no service" or one bar.  I get the wonderful UMA calling, which routes calls over wifi networks, to use where T-Mobile lacks service.Blackberry 6 is a great update.  The various apps are nicely integrated with the device and with each other, you do not need to pop into the photos to find a picture, back out, then in to another app to post the picture, you can just roll through the menu to do it right from the posting app.  Much more convenient.  The universal search is very useful.  The browser is still a bit slow and not as smoothly intuitive as the iPhone's Safari browser, but it is way better than older blackberry browsers.I am very very happy with this phone!UPDATE, July 2012:I still love this phone!  Still works superbly, and has held up really well; still looks brand new!  I love the messaging capabilities of this phone, and it works really well as a phone too.  Comfortable in the hand, gets good clear calls, easy to find and call contacts.  I'm sad to read of BlackBerry woes, they make great phones!  I would love to upgrade to the new ones but this one just works so well I can't justify the expense.
B004CLY8TC	This is my second Blackberry.  Upgraded from the old BB Curve 8560.  Love the new OS 6 and universal search mode.  New camera upgrade is great with useful settings.  The MP3 sound quality is wonderful.  Screen is crisp.  Battery lasts for days and I am a heavy user.  Love my BBM and its new upgrades too.  I thought of switching to ATT for the BB Torch but found it to be sluggish.  I like the ability to be able to surf and use this phone one handed when I need too.  I have been with TMo since 2002 and am sad that ATT has bought it over.  My husband has ATT and it has poor customer service at a higher price.  The Blackberry will also play MP4 format songs which works well since both my children have iTouches and we can share music.  As for the screen size, I am able to read books using the BB Kindle app with ease.  This is solid, well built and efficient phone.  There are more apps now and our favorite is the shared shopping list that works for both Android (my husband) and my BB.  Makes grocery shopping a breeze.  Hope this helps.  You can also share Kindle ebooks with the various Apple and BB devices.
B005HR9VSI	This is the best smartphone on the market hands down, in particular, for someone who is not in love with typing emails on a touch screen only phone. This device provides the best of both worlds - (1) a QWERTY keyboard that no one can dispute is the best keyboard on the market (its smoothness and ease of typing is incredible and even vastly better than earlier blackberries) and (2) a crystal clear touch screen. It is also razor thin and incredibly sleek looking. While the outages this past week may turn some people off, RIM will surely do whatever they can to make sure that never happens again (and that is was a rare occurrence), and despite the outage, RIM's email service is still the best in the game. Instant push emails allows users to respond quickly and not get behind when emails pile up. The new operating system and browser is a vast improvement as well.As I said above, in my opinion, this is the best smartphone in the market.
B005HR9VSI	The IPhone software and apps are the most elegant in the world.  Pair that with the hardware on this phone, it's gorgeously tactile keyboard and slim shape, and the Bold 9930 would be perfect.  Just because I don't think there is a smartphone with a hard keyboard out there that is better than a Blackberry, I wish that RIM would sell itself to someone who knows how to write software and provide excellent service.  I don't want the Blackberry to be a Palm also-ran.Having owned an IPhone, I miss the intuitiveness and the richness of the apps.  I'm not a frivolous phone person - I want financial apps, organizational apps, health apps, but it's clear that app providers smell blood on RIM.  Why spend the effort on a dying platform?  But the Apps that are there are wonderful:  Facebook, Twitter, Google Talk, Google Voice, BBM, Google Maps, Wikitude...Beware however - there is a known defect on the Bold 9930 that causes it to brick (yes - completely and utterly useless) if its battery drains and you charge it overnight.  The only recourse is to have Verizon send you a new phone (under warranty).  I have just updated the OS on my 9930 to OS 7.1, which I hope addresses the issue.  It wasn't fun having no phone for 3 days while I waited for my replacement.  There are people who have gone through 2-3 phones this way.  The update did not go smoothly (contrast with IPad, Mac, IPhone updates which are impeccable), but eventually got it working.I hope our perseverance pays off - and the brand goes to a deserving party that knows how to please its loyalists and make defectors take another look.
B005HR9VSI	It was contract renewal time, so visions of new phones for myself and my family danced through my head.  I'd been pouring over every detail of the droid phones and the iPhone.  My 14 year old son asked..."Aren't they running out of things for phones to do?"  I laughed, but then I thought about his question.It's a loaded question and I knew what he was getting at.  The silliness of the phone 'pissing contest' with all the youtube videos comparing one to another. The giant screens.  Useless gimmicks like `Siri'I decided to stop, take a breath, and decide what I truly needed in a PHONE. I had 160 apps on my Droid and I literally used about 10-15 of those.  The rest were part of the 'pissing contest' ("Hey, do you see what my phone can do!?  Bro-stache!  Voice warping software!  3D games!")I needed 100% accuracy in texts and emails.  Clear phone calls.  At least a workdays worth of battery life (10 hours of heavy usage).  Contacts and calendar sync with gmail.  `To do' list.  The ability to handle multiple email accounts, including Exchange.  A simple, decent camera.  Medical apps like Epocrates.  Music apps like Pandora, Shazaam, Slacker radio.  Utilities like Evernote, Dropbox.  You get the idea.  Mostly as a functioning phone, a real phone with organizing tools, but with a few entertainment things.First let me say that it is truly a beautiful phone.  Slim, sleek, stunning design.  One of the best LOOKING phones ever.  The touch screen is vivid, crisp, and clear.Now, about my `needs' from my PHONE.Accuracy.  I am a physican at a busy hospital and we communicate with each other EXTENSIVELY via text throughout the day.  The main problem I'd had with my Droid Incredible was the virtual keyboard.  If I spent an hour a day texting, literally 15 minutes of that time would be erasing incorrect 'auto corrections'.  My thumbs will never get smaller, I will always hit the wrong keys on a virtual keyboard.  I had several keyboards on the Droid with very sophisticated prediction software, learning the words I used most, etc.  It will never be good enough.  iPhone keyboard is far worse, with absolutely horrid options for customization.  Blackberry 9930 keyboard is the best thing I've ever typed on.  I've never used a BB before but I took to it instantly.Instead of BB's stupid Bold commercial showing bicyclists with glow-in-the-dark wheels driving around, they need to show me at the hospital smashing my virtual keyboard phone against the wall....then cut away to me smiling as I discover what typing on a phone can be like.  Stunning.  If texting, emailing, and accuracy are important to you, don't underestimate this keyboard as it truly separates this phone from anything else available.Clear, loud phone calls.  EXCELLENT noise reduction.  People hear me and I hear them.  Perfect.Battery is decent.  BB users are not thrilled because they are spoiled with 2 days of use in their old, slow, no feature phones.  This thing is fast, with a brilliant screen, and it needs juice.  I am thrilled with it because I come from the land of Droid where you have to charge the phone multiple times per day.  It gets me through long days.  I bought the extra battery with dual charger from Amazon, but I have not had to use the second battery yet.  There's a HUGE extended battery available, but it makes it look nuts.  Some people don't mind, but I love the sleek look, so I will never get that.Syncs with gmail, contacts, calendar.  Not as smoothly/thoroughly as Droid devices, of course, but it works very well.Multiple email accounts no problem.  POP, IMAP, Exchange.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the camera!  It doesn't have `auto focus' it has some sort of way to focus on everything at the same time.  Forget what they call it?  IT DOES NOT TAKE CLOSE-UP PICTURES WELL!  So, if you are buying your phone with a need for close-up photos, this phone will not suit you.  The dedicated camera key is soooo convenient.  Why is this not on every phone?  Fast, clear, fun to take pictures.BB app world has an atrocious set up.  It's confusing, some apps are not represented in BB app world, you have to go to the developer web site to get many programs, app world constantly signs you out when you are browsing on the computer, etc.  But most of the major apps are available, and they work fine.  Everything I need is available.  You too will be fine with apps, it will just take a little digging.  App world needs some work.OH, one of the things I love the absolute most about this phone is the INSTANT UNIVERSAL SEARCH!  Start typing and the phone starts searching your apps, your texts/emails, contacts, etc for matches.  You can set it up so it searches just the things you want it to search.  It's amazing and it's INSTANT.  It's better than iPhone's swipe (that's already an extra step), and type (on the virtual keyboard that sucks), and it includes INSTANT WEB SEARCHES AS YOU TYPE VIA BING!!  Amazing.  (As an aside, I love google search and I think you can set it to that, but I'm finding Bing's TV commercials are pretty accurate.  I'm getting too much irrelevant information on google.  Bing is pretty impressive.)I suggest you sit down and write out what you need from your phone.  This BB will NEVER beat iPhone and the latest Droids for speed, apps, screen size, gaming.  But, it doesn't need to because it's a better PHONE.Love this phone.  My wife got the Galaxy Nexus as did one of my sons.  My other boy got an iPhone 4S.  I feel that my choice is a better actual functioning phone.  I LOVE IT.  However, I won't win the `pissing contest' as they are downloading the latest 3D Magic 8-ball app.
B005HR9VSI	Had the Curve 9930. Tried a Droid. Back to Blackberry. This is a great phone, not a toy... If you want to watch Netflix, get a 60" TV. This phone rocks and the keypad does make life easy for all of the E-Mail I do... They do make a solid product for the Serious Business Man...
B005HR9VSI	I happen to be part of a family that loves the iPhone. BUT, I work at a corporation that committed early to the Blackberry, and has not yet developed the infrastructure to support the iPhone. So when my 2-year-old BB finally croaked a couple of months back, I was stuck getting another Blackberry. I asked around and was told that of the available replacement choices, the BB 9930 was the most iPhone-like.And it is.Which is not to say that its workings and apps are equivalent to the iPhone's! But they are sufficiently close that I finally feel I have mostly caught up. I now have OK camera functions, music, internet, and the ability to synch with my laptop's Outlook mail, calendar, contacts and phone. But the deficiencies, slight though they night be, are obvious. My recent phone list sometimes, but not always, shows my latest calls. The camera's ability to post pix to Facebook comes and goes. The GUI that lets me set an alarm is backwards to what my intuition would dictate. And without built-in iPod and iTunes, managing my music is just not what I want. In nearly all ways, the slickness, workmanship and love that makes the iPhone such a delight to use is lacking.But on the positive side, I can swipe my fingers across the touch-sensitive screen and view new content. Typing on the physical keyboard might even be preferable to the iPhone's virtual keyboard. And Blackberry's cursor control, in which a wheel or pad allows a fingertip to move the cursor, actually allows more text editing flexibility than the iPhone's clunky-by-comparison I-bar placement. I am pleased with the sound quality of the phone and the ease of switching to speakerphone mode.For what it's worth, I still think the iPhone is a superior machine. But in the interim - until my company decides to support Apple products - the 9930 will do nicely.(FYI: the 5-star ratuing is really 4.5 stars.)
B005HR9VSI	There is no better phone than the Bold 9930.  Best antenna ever -- fewer dropped calls.  Longer battery life.  And best of all, the best keyboard ever offered on a phone.  This is without a doubt the best phone I've ever used.  That is, if you really need a phone that works as a communication tool, as opposed to an app-running toy.
B005HR9VSI	Reasons I chose to upgrade from my BlackBerry Tour to this phone, over an iPhone:1. OS 7 is fast.2. Sleek design.3. Physical Keyboard is awesome.  Can't stand typing or, even worse, editing on a virtual keyboard.4. Global roaming capable.5. Removable (i.e. easily upgradeable and inexpensive) microSD.6. Standard microUSB, not proprietary connector / charger.7. Touchpad is aweseome.8. Touch screen is a bonus.9. BlackBerry Bridge to work with my PlayBook.10. BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server) delivers INSTANT email.  No other phone works that quickly, often with a 2-10 minute delay.  Very important to me to keep up at work.  Also most tightly integrated with Outlook (even pictures of my contacts are on my BB).So far, I have not had any reliability issues.  Apps are limited compared to the iPhone but majority of those I need are available.  The ones that are missing for the BB tend to be more entertaining (e.g. Angry Birds) than useful tools.
B005HR9VSI	As of about two months ago, my employer has saddled me with this particular model of Frustration Generating device.  Since then I have quickly become aware of why the Blackberry is rarely mentioned amongst other devices for which apps are most commonly available.It is so prone to erroneous screen item selections, it is non-intuitive, non-user friendly, and unreliable due to poor construction.  The final breaking point for me is that, after only about two months with this device, the keyboard is already gradually beginning to fail.  First the 'S' key repeats.  Then the 'S' key reacts when other keys around it are pressed.  Now the 'R' key is beginning to exhibit the same behavior.  It's even starting to effect the Cursor/Trackpad and causing unexpected dialing while trying to operate the Trackpad.No, nothing has been spilt on the device and no, it has not been dropped.I have searched the issue to find that this is a common symptom with Blackberrys as reported by other users experiencing the same behavior.Blackberry's Support suggests the only resolution is to return the phone to have the keyboard replaced.  Some individuals in the support forums have tried to suggest a software update, however most of the people trying a software update have insisted they are already up-to-date or that they tried an update with no positive results.  So, of course, actually replacing the keyboard is the only real solution.  However, I also see that people who have attempted to have the keyboard replaced report that they are told they will have to wait a week for the phone to be sent out for repair, during which time they are expected to be without a phone.  And I'm sure that one week estimation is being generous in regard to the amount of time it will be before a working phone is returned.  Regardless, my employer expects to be able to contact me at anytime so I cannot be without the phone long enough for the repair.  Which means I'm stuck with this thing behaving as it does.The fact that it was issued by my employer is the only reason it still exists in one piece.At least it wasn't my own money wasted on this glorified paperweight.  After it's gone I will certainly not be replacing it with one of my own.  That is for sure!
B005HR9VSI	I have been a Blackberry users for YEARS. I had the Torch 9800 for about a year, hating it every day .... When I saw this phone for one penny on Amazon, I jumped on the chance to get it. I LOVE THIS PHONE!!
B005HR9VSI	The trackpads on both of the 9930's I bought from Amazon third party sellers featured slightly crooked trackpads in the counter-clockwise direction.On one of them, the sensitivity of the trackpad itself was way too low - I wouldn't have realized this if not for the other 9930 I tried, on which the trackpad, while crooked, was quick and fluid.But on the phone with the good (but crooked) trackpad, the Back button was squeaky when you press it - very, VERY annoying.Blackberry's Quality Control actually let these things ship like that? Unacceptable.Then there's the atrociously designed (search doesn't even really work) and underwhelming Blackberry App-World - clearly developers have forsaken the entire platform, including Google (an ancient version of google maps).I am pretty sure I'm within my rights to expect squared up geometry and non-flimsy, rock solid buttons, but apparently RIM can't compete in the build-quality area anymore, and these things cost too much for anything less than perfect.The camera lacks auto-focus, another critical error, although it still beats Motorola cameras (which ain't sayin' much).
B005HR9VSI	Dream phone. This is it. For anyone who first and foremost needs a communications device, there is none better. The iPhone and Android toy phones are ok too, of course, for those who first want a toy and the bigger the better.  But, hey, there are so many better toys for that, why even bother to us a phone for that.This Blackberry is a reliable and easy to use communicator first. Everything else is a bonus, from beautiful styling, display, thousands of decent apps and incredible functionality. Sure there are some should haves and would haves but they're quickly forgotten once you start using this beauty. The incredible feel of cool-to-the-touch stainless steel and classy look of the 9930 make most the latest plastic brick-sized smart?phones feel cheap and tacky, never mind what's inside.Yes, they have slicker browsers and media. But the Bold is no slouch. The native browser is a vast improvement and others, such as Opera Mini also work extremely well. No complaints there at all. If you need physical keys, the keyboard makes you want keep on typing and typing.  Nothing else like it out there. The battery will last way into the night even with heavy usage and a good deal of browsing news and information. Heavy video streaming is another story, but again, this is supposed to be a communications device first.After trying all the latest smartphones over the years, including iPhone, it's hard to imagine a connected life without this BB. It seems like the perfect balance between productivity and entertainment. In meetings, it makes you wish for urgent calls and messages, just to pull it out and be noticed and envied by the toy owners.
