B000OC3SB2	I ordered this product based on the description which listed about 20 models including mine. When I received the item it only fit 3 or 4 models and did not fit my phone. Now I get screwed out of the money becasue paying for the return shipping just puts me farther in the hole than eating this purchase. It's things like this that keep me buying from a real, brick & mortar store and not online.
B000OC3SB2	Ordered for a Motorola i930, all items as specified and worked with my phone.  Speedy delivery, too!
B000OC3SB2	to be honest havent tryed this one out yet but if it says motorola on it u know its a great product
B000OC3SB2	I didn't believe i was actually going to get this charger for that price. i figured something was going to be wrong...but it was exactly what i wanted and it works great. i am a real person writing this :)A very surprised and happy person :)
B000OC3SB2	This is a great product and I got a super deal on it.  Fast delivery, too.
B000OC3SB2	The accessory bundle and chargers all work as expected. I'm very satisfied with the fast shipping and the products.
B000OC3SB2	I would love to review this product, but BARGAINCELL charged my credit card and never the item.
B0018PUBT6	Using this product to power a single cell 3.7Vdc charger, for field charging of model aircraft batteries. Needed a convertor for AT LEAST 6Vdc @ 1.5A. This unit is functioning just fine at 6Vdc @ 2A. Charger unit functioning just fine on this supply. Would recommend this to others.
B0018PUBT6	This adapter works as it is supposed to, but stands out from so many other power adapters in that the power plug has both a power LED and a power switch. This feature should be in all 12 volt plugs. It would save a lot of wear and tear on both plug and receptacle.
B0018PUBT6	Good price for the replacement charger.  The employee I gave it to has no had any complaints.  Would buy again in the future
B0018PUBT6	Works great!  Shipped fast!  I wish these things lasted a little longer...but I use them a lot too...
B0018PUBT6	If you buy a booster that requires a 6v input, buy a spare.  We have over 50 cell phone boosters and if the booster does not work, it is 85% of the time, the power supply.  It is well made and when you plug it in, you know it will work.
B004LYR2C0	Wilson makes top of the line cellular repeater products. The Wilson AG Pro 75 dB adjustable gain dual band amplifier in this kit is as good as it gets. With automatic 'oscillation'/'feedback' detection and adjustable gain, it makes it easy to set up your exterior and interior antennas. The internal panel antenna in the kit is directional and thus helps in avoiding feedback also. The wide-band directional external antenna works in both cellular (800 MHz) and PCS (1900 MHz) range (in some weak signal situations you may want to use the Yagi antennas from Wilson instead, which provide the highest gain permitted by the FCC, but do require two separate antennas, one for the CLR band and one for the PCS band --- or, consider the parabolic dishes from ZDA Communications, which have excellent gain, directionality, low side lobes and high back-to-front ratio). Finally, the R400 coax from Wilson has only 4 dB per 100' attenuation (even RG-6 has over 8dB per 100' loss) -- for runs over 100', consider substituting the thicker Wilson R600, which has even lower loss).
B004LYR2C0	I finally was able to install the items properly and it works great when it comes to amplifing the signal, the rnage inside is not as good may need differnt antenna
B004LYR2C0	Most anything Wilson is worth the money--at least in my opinion.  I've dealt with their products for about the last 12 years (mostly mobile) and they've always held up.  Hopefully this kit won't be any different.  We've been using it for a month now and it works GREAT in our office.
B004LYR2C0	We are working on a concrete framed home at a beach location with little to no cell reception to start. We called Wilson tech support and they convinced us that if we set this up correctly it would work. The key is to make sure you get the outside directional antenna aimed correctly. From there we installed three inside antennas and and additional booster amp and two taps. The home is 7 floors and mostly concrete and metal construction. The movie theater is two stories subterranean.  When we fired it up all the workers phones started beeping with messages and ringing with calls. For two years they have worked with virtually no cell phones. Now AT&T; and Verizon users usually have 4-5 bars and NO dropped calls ANYWHERE in the home.  People in the neighborhood can walk by and pull a stronger signal from the street that we are providing over the cell phone company.Highly recommended and Wilson tech support was very patient and walked us through each step.
B004LYR2C0	I purchased this for an office located inside of a metal building.  Before we received no signal or maybe one bar if you were near a window.  With the booster, we now have 4 bars.  So far so good, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  No more missed calls or going outside to use the phone.
B004LYR2C0	I am 43 km away (27 mi.) from the cell tower in the Canadian Laurentians as the crow flies. Furthermore, the signal has to get around 2 mountains at the same height as the radiating tower. Hooked-up to 2 yagi antennas stacked on top of one another, this amplifier turn out to be the only working device at my cabin in the wilderness. Getting both GSM in the 850-900 MHz and 3G signals 5M5 even in bad weather conditions. It literally made the difference between phone and no-phone at all. Highly recommended for areas in  fringe areas of cell reception (having intermittent -101 to -104 dBm to start with on the roof of the cabin!).
B004LYR2C0	before this our office couldn't get data connection, after putting this up on the outside of our building we get great service!
B004LYR2C0	We had a 48,000 sqft building with very poor cell reception. The AG Pro 75 complete kit worked very well in our installation, along with additional Wilson Electronics components we needed for our large building. We installed this system over the course of two days and it boosted our cell reception for both AT&T; and Verizon from 0-2 bars of reception to 5 immediately. Just read the online installation guide on their website and call them with any questions about your particular installation plans.We're ordering another system for our second building at the same site. I would recommend this system to any person or company needing to boost your cell reception. It is solidly built, easy to install, and the Wilson Electronics support staff was very helpful when I was in the design/layout phase. Highly recommended!
B004LYR2C0	Wilson 75db booster works flawlessly had to turn down to 60 and 65 db. Will not boost LTE. STILL GREAT! I recommend this booster, especially for steel buildings!
B004LYR2C0	I bought this kit in an attempt to improve the non-existent cell signal inside my home. Outside my house, I'd have two to three bars... inside, we'd get maybe one bar on a good day. Most times I'd try to call my wife at home (on her cell) and her phone wouldn't even ring. I was a little concerned that I'd have problems with this kit because it has a directional antenna that works best with an unobstructed path to the cell tower you are trying to communicate with. My house is surrounded by large, dense trees that completely obscure about fifty degrees of the horizon where the cell tower is located. With little effort, I was able to get a great signal from the cell tower (Sprint PCS). I added an additional indoor antenna -Wilson Dual Band (700-2700 MHz), which required more cable -50 feet WILSON400 Ultra Low Loss Coax, a splitter -Wilson 700-2700 MHz Splitter, a short piece of coax (to run the splitter to the amp) -Wilson 2-Foot WILSON400 Ultra Low Loss Coax. I probably didn't need the additional indoor antenna, but I tend to go for overkill when I tackle a project. I mounted the outside antenna withWinegard DS-2000 Universal Antenna Mount with U-boltsby simply drilling through my siding and attaching the mount with 6 3/16&#34;x2&#34; lag bolts. Drilled through a side roof vent, ran the cable inside and caulked the hole. Then went into my attic, added an outlet to plug my amp into, then ran the two indoor antennas through the attic and placed them face down in the attic under the insulation. Now we have a three to six bar signal throughout our home where before our cellphones were virtually unusable.The only issue I have is that the seller did not include a lightning surge protector with this kit. I had to purchaseWilson Electronics 859902 Surge Protectoralong with an additional short length of cable, as well as electrical wire and a grounding rod to make this system safe in my home. I understand not including the electric wire and the grounding rod, as these can be purchased at any hardware store, but the surge protector is so important and so application specific that it should be included with the kit. Folks, this kind of surge protector isn't like the power bar you plug your computer or TV into. The coax cable screws into either side of it and then an electric cable connects it to a copper coated rod that you pound into the ground. If you don't protect your computer and there's a surge, you might have your computer destroyed. If you don't surge protect this cell phone signal booster kit and lightning strikes the cell antenna, there is a very good chance that the lightning will cause an electrical explosion in your attic and burn your house down.All things considered, this is a great kit that worked wonders in my home. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to boost the signal in their home or office. Just make sure you add the surge suppressor to the kit.
B004LYR2C0	This amplifier does work great....but...a few things you need to know....the setup I purchased came with a directional amplifier....if you can see the cell tower or know exactly where it is without seeing  (line of sight) this this should work for you really well because it is a high gain.  It did not work for me because I am so far remote I have no idea where the nearest cell is, and I have rolling hills.  I went back and purchased the Wilson Omnidirectional antenna.  It worked better as far as signal strength than the directional, only because the direction must be pointed at the target.
