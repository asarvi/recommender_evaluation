B0054NEJQY	Love thsi case, it provides great weight and added support for this phone.  When I originally got the phone it seemed a little frail, but once you add this case it fits great and adds that extra dimension of size and grip that I needed.
B0054NEJQY	The case looks exactly as it is pictured and described! It fits the phone nicely and adds a great grip as well! The on/off and volume buttons are even easier to press. So glad I made this purchase!
B0054NEJQY	Bought this to replace the T-Mobile brand case and it's leaps and bounds nicer looking.  It has a somewhat gummy edging on it which is nice to grab onto, but at the same time doesn't get stuck in your pocket.  The backing is clear (smoke) and hard plastic.  Can be removed very easily but doesn't fall off on its own ever.
B0054NEJQY	Got my case within 4 days, very quick shipping. The case is very nice and fits the phone perfectly. Isnt big and protects the phone. I recommend ordering this product.
B0054NEJQY	this case fits snugly, protects the mobile, looks clean and has a nice 'gummy' grip on the mobile's periphery w/ the solid feel of higher quality plastic on the back. previously, i had bought the 'body glove' case for the g2x, it looked nice, but drop it once and the case, which is two pieces, pops right off the mobile; furthermore, if you ever have to take the 'body glove' case off, you're liable to damage/break the outer snap-on piece eventually. this case is far less expensive, yet surprisingly better in many ways.i initially bought one of these cases for my g2x, then bought a 2nd for my girlfriend's mobile after being so impressed.
B0054NEJQY	This case is truly great! All of the good things being reported are dead-on! The ONE & ONLY downside is the charger port. However, there are several chargers available that do fit. There are not many USB cables that fit though and if your like me and plug your device into your car radio to play your music while driving, this is an issue. All I simply did was file down the black rubber on the USB cable that surrounds the male end of the micro USB. If you take just a bit off of the edges it will wedge into the charge port of the case just fine... A VERY SMALL price to pay for such a cheap, durable, good looking case. I get compliments all the time. Also, I am a rooted user, so I pull my battery out often. Taking the phone out and putting it back in this case takes literally 5 seconds or less. Highly recommend the case, you will not be disappointed, unless you buy this expecting an Otter case...
B0054NEJQY	Received my case at least 3 days sooner than promised. Fits perfectly, easy to put on and take off. 2 stars because I have to take the case off everytime I want to charge my phone, the charger will not stay in if the case is on. Same problem with the headphone jack, it sometimes pops out just enough to channel sound through only one ear piece then you have to push it back in, the precut hole on the case needs to be bigger. Having to remove the case everytime I charge my phone is disappointing but not a big deal to me. If I used the headphones more often I would give this product 1 star.
B0054NEJQY	It's looks and feels great. Only problem is the hole for the charger is not cut out properly. It's an good buy and way cheaper than the covers at the store.
B0054NEJQY	product fits snug and tight and protects the key elements. i have dropped my phone a few times already and not a dent or scratch. works great
B0054NEJQY	Nice slim case, the only thing is, some chargers don't fit it, but other than that its nice and I like it.
B0054NEJQY	Fits the phone well, easy to remove and put back on.  Covers the phone nicely.  Sticks out on the front of the phone a little, helps protect the screen if you lay it down screen side down.  Volume buttons are actually easier to push than when before I had the case.  All-in-all a good case and I'm satisfied with it.
B0054NEJQY	Fits really good. Doesn't come off. And has a good grip. The only thing I hate is that when I try to put my phone in charge the charger falls off sometimes.
B0054NEJQY	I'm extremely happy with this case. much better than the $30 one at the T-mobile store. Fits well, is comfortable to hold. there are holes for the input ports, and sort of hard embedded buttons that go over the on/off and vol buttons. They work easily. You cannot go wrong at this price. if I'm smart, I'll buy another for a back-up.
B0054NEJQY	I love everything about this case. This is is not one of those rubber cases that becomes loose over time. this is nice looking flexible case that actually makes it easier to hit the power and volume buttons.
B0054NEJQY	Case has a snug fit.  Doesn't add heft to the phone or make the form factor of the phone odd.The only things I noticed, the smooth finish does make it prone to sliding around.  Also the opening for the usb isn't big enough, it doesn't allow the charger to go in completely.  One of my car chargers wouldn't work because of this.Other than that, probably one of the best phone cases I have purchased.  Wish I could say that about the phone, unfortunately that I am returning.
B0054NEJQY	yeah this cover is very good, as the other reviews mentioned it makes the phone easier to grip and the buttons are easy to push when using this cover..It has a nice gloss black look to it and it doesnt attract lint if you keep it in your pocket..it fits the phone nice and snug..5 stars
B0054NEJQY	Cover looks Great no bulk and better fit than you might expect. I don't think it offers that much impact protection however, it will protect your phone from from scrathes.Cons: the charging port isn't open enough so the charger falls out easy.
B0054NEJQY	Wow. OMGBBQ. 1337. WOW.That's all I really have to say about this case.....well, I guess I'll say a bit more, this case deserves it. Having used a few cases for my g2x, including the Speck candy shell, cheap ebay tpu's. etc, I can say this case is the best case I've ever used on my phone. The combination of flexible TPU material and a hard, matte plastic back makes for such a wonderful feeling in your hand. This combo gives just the right amount of grip around the sides, without the case feeling sticky or clingy. Its much better than a full TPU (which is an finger oil magnet) or full slick plastic like on the Speck (which has no grip at all, and is a fingerprint magnet) Plus, the hard matte back makes the g2x's flimsy battery door feel super sturdy. LG should have included this case with every phone they sold to make up for that piece of junk battery door.The case also fits perfectly. Most of the cases you buy outside of the t-mobile branding are typically made for the LG Optimus 2X, which is g2x's slightly taller cousin. Ebay merchants will often market the cases as being compatible with both models, which is not the case. My g2x would often be very loose in those cases. This case, however, fits perfectly for this case. The matte-finish buttons on the case are also very, very easy to press, which is a feat the other cases have yet to accomplish. In fact, the case makes the buttons EASIER to press than without. (Also, no random cut-out on the top right!! Yay!)One beef I have against this case: the charger port. Its sorta cut extra small, so the default LG charger cable will not fit too well into it. It'll still charge, just that it will fall out randomly from the case pushing against the charger. This isn't a major problem personally, since USB cables and chargers are so easy to get nowadays, and there are plenty with smaller heads, like some of the ones Motorola has.This case is really, really wonderful. I would recommend everyone to get one. Thinking about getting a case? Look no further. Have a case already? Throw it out and get this one. Don't have a g2x? Go buy one and get this case.EDIT: So I wrote the review after about 30 minutes of using the case on my phone and playing around with it. But after using the case for a full day and showing it to my friends, I'm even more impressed, and more in love with this case. Most of them actually thought it was a brand new phone when they felt it. It feels as if my phone had a major upgrade, and a lot of friends actually wanted my case for their iPhone 4's!! The case makes the phone feel absolutely amazing, and if you purchased any other case, or don't use a case for your phone, I really suggest you give this one a shot, I'm glad I did!
B0054NEJQY	i love this case. it has a nice texture and fits the g2x snug....just one downfall, the charging cable that came with the g2x keeps falling out (due to the small opening allowed for the micro usb port in the bottom of the case). i had to use a different cable with a smaller end and my problem was solved.
B0054NEJQY	This is actually a pretty good case except for the fact that you need to take out the phone every time you want to charge it.
B005THSAZQ	I've tried them all. I've probably bought 50 iPhone cases in the last 5 years. These are really nice and stay put once they are snapped on. I get a lot of compliments on this case. This case is good quality, it hasn't broken. One word of advice, if you want to remove your phone from the case very often then this isn't the one for you as it snaps together around the phone. It's not meant to be taken on and off a lot.
B005THSAZQ	Fits well and looks/feels good. Very happy. Never dropped it so I have no idea of protection. slides in an out of pocket well.
B005THSAZQ	This is a nice case if you want thin protection that slides out of your pocket easily.I dropped it once and while it seemed to protect the phone, the hard case chipped easily. Luckily it was just cosmetic but a slightly harder fall would ruin this case.I didn't realize when I bought it that the case is actually two pieces that snap together but that isn't as big a deal as I thought, other than making it difficult to remove often.The holes on the case are all large enough for easy access with the exception of the headphone jack which is too close on one side making some larger aux-in cords difficult to use. But a normal cord works fine. Also, the hole around the volume buttons could be bigger and sometimes makes it difficult to take a picture with one hand using the volume button.Overall this is a good case that I enjoy as the most important thing to me is sliding out of my pocket easily.
B005THSAZQ	This is a decent iphone cover. I previously had an otter box for my phone but didn't like the fact that it &#34;clung&#34; to the lining of my handbags and pockets making removal frustrating. This cover works much better! It has a soft feel but&#34; isn't slippery in the hand.&#34;.
B005THSAZQ	This is the 2nd case I have purchased for my 4s and I love it.It is quite slim, easy to apply and looks great.The buttons are easy to access, and the camera aperture / flash is not occluded.The cover has a nice hand feel, but is not too slippery.I have dropped the phone a few times and it has sustained no damage.
