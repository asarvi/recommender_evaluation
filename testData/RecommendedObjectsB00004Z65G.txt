B003WV391Q	I am not sure how these sound, but when I am strangling a farm-raised ostrich for a gourmet meal, only the FINEST tools will suffice.  Needless to say, the headphone wire on these is great for ostriches and it probably works on cassowarys, too.
B003WV391Q	I bought these to use with my iPhone - primarily while studying for school.  The sound quality is amazing and I've had a few premium headphones over the years.  The bass is rich, the treble bright but not overwhelming.  While the price is pretty high, they do live up to the promise.  I'm very pleased with my purchase!
B003WV391Q	Wow these sound amazing. I am 48 years old and was listening to music I have owned since high school with these headphones today and heard things I've never heard before. Used them on my IPhone4, ITouch and my classic 160gb and they sound wonderful on all devices. They are so clean and clear. I have owned high end Klpsch, Shure, Koss, Sony, Beats and Bose and these are by far the best. The Bass is tuneable to your liking. They come with a ton of tips to pick from so they are a great fit. my musical taste is all over the place...from Bach and Motzart to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Steely Dan to industrial, goth and rap and everything in between and they all sound better with these headphones. I also used them on my high end surround sound system and movies never sounded better. I think that I have found the keeper. No more searching, buying and selling of headphones for me. The best headphones on the market hands down.ps.i have 19,762 songs on my ipod
B003WV391Q	My ie8 broken 2 weeks ago, and after long search i finally buy ie 8i as part of semi sidegrade.compare to normal ie8 this 8i have much weaker base, if i'm not buy directly from amazon i would think it was fake, on top of it the adjustable base on iem itself doesn't seems working. with my old ie8 there big difference between lowest and highest base setting on headphone itself, it make no difference in 8i model.i just got this few days and only burn in for 30+ hours.. i will give another 70 hour burn in and hope the base open up. otherwise i think i would return this and get westone UM3x.
B003WV391Q	These sound great, however the fit is painful no matter how I rotate them. I can tolerate them for an hour or two, but that is about it. Really too bad, because I love the way these perform acoustically.
B003WV391Q	great sound, comfortable and defiantly worth the money. bought it as a replacement for a lower model and it out preforms them in every way.
B003WV391Q	Not an audiophile by any means but I LOVE MY MUSIC!  I listen to various genres of music but predominantly HIP HOP, Rap, R&B;, Dub Step and selected pop music like Jessie J for instance. I own a set of Beats by Dre Studio headphones which I used as my main phones of choice in most environments, including just walking around, watching DVDs and even in the gym. For my style of music, they were almost perfect and delivered awesome, controlled bass and clear mids and highs. I almost went for a set of Denon AHD 5000 but plumbed for the Beats after much soul searching!They have been awesome and I have had no gripes other than the fact that the cables have both frayed at the point here they attach to the buds. This is due more to my use. Than any inherent flawes so I take full responsibility!  I decided to get replacement cables but to stop using them as my everyday set of phones and keep them for more sedate use. I therefore decided to in vest in a decent set of IEMs.I have owned various IE headphones it he past of varying quality. The problem I have had with all of them is the fact that the fit is never exactly right and. They are always a struggle to keep in - I have small ears!! Another, more serious problem is that they almost all ended up faulty with the sound from one side beckoning intermittent then stoping altogether!!Having got used to the quality of the Beats, I couldn't settle on anything other than a comparable set of IEMs. After much research and reading and comparing loads of reviews, I ordered a set of Monster Turbines. I decided early on to invest in a set of custom in ear moulds to put to bed the problems I have always had with fitment and also to finally get the best ini noise isolation and sound reproduction! After checking the ASC website, I discovered they did not do custom moulds for the Turbines. After looking through their current list and again comparing models, I chose the Sennheiser IE8s and ordered them from Amazon. When they arrives, I discovered they were in fact IE8is!!! The inclusion of the remote was an unexpected bonus!I've read a lot about the 'burn in' period required to get the best out these phones. If that is the case , I can't wait because out of the box they sound AWESOME! Back to back comparisons with the Beats Studio puts them head and shoulders above the Studios! The overall quality of sound is cleaner and the base more than holds it's own without being over powering. It seems more controlled and delivers a tighter punch while still delivering mids and highs that come through beautifully. Granted, fitment is still a bit hit and miss but when I attach the included over ear accessory, the buds stay firmly in place even if not fully 'locked' in ear. This is not a big problem as I always intended to have. The custom moulds made - the impression of which I had made yesterday!!!To get an idea of what they WILL sound like, I simply cup my hands over my ears and press the buds firmly into my ear canals and they are transformed to an even higher plane of excellence!!  The overall price (200.00 for IE8s + 100.00 for moulds inc P&P;) brings the overall quality to a level of IEM costing almost twice as much, if not more. Even then, at that price, investment in custom moulds would be almost mandatory, raising the cost even higher.When I get the moulds, I will write a more detailed review as, by then, they would have had a chance to burn in more!!
B003WV391Q	I've bought 4 different brands/models  over 100 USD inEar headphones to test.Sennheiser IE 8i had the best sound.Though I didn't keep it since I like to switch songs often in the middle and listen to a next one. Sennheiser's remote was INCONVENIENT in this model: too small buttons and the sensitivity also bad (need to press too hard, sometimes it skipped 2 songs).Go for it if you listen your music without switching the tracks often!P.S. By the way I didn't like to wear them with a cord over the ear. I wanted to have a simple plug-in headphones.So I switched left and right headphones (they are detachable in this IE 8i Sennheiser) to preserve the 'order' and have been using them as most usual inEar headphones. With premium sound quality.
B003WV391Q	The package is old ,but the earphone is OK,I love it! Thank you for your good service! I will choose your store again!
B003WV391Q	I tried it on the macbook and the sound was cinema like. It's so crisp, it takes time to get used to. When using other in-ear you notice the difference immediately. I would recommend using it on less than a laptop without an amp. Great product! a legend!
B003WV391Q	This is a very good headphones, very comfortable to wear, and it is suitable for listening to classical musics. And the transport is quick.
B003WV391Q	Package|AccessoriesThe IE8 comes in an attractive, sturdy package that consists of many accessories. They include cable guides, shirt clip, cleaning tool/bass knob key, 10 sets of eartips, and a protective case. The protective case is pretty bulky for travel but it's pretty, lined with brushed aluminum.Fit|Isolation|AppearanceThe IE8 fits snug and very well in the ear. It's very comfortable, even when worn to sleep. The isolation with the included eartips however, is not that great. It depends on the ear but I found the Monster foam Supertips to work very well for isolation. The design is pretty simple, nothing too fancy. The housing has the Sennheiser logo and the adjustable bass knob is visible.Build|CableThe build quality of the IE8 is outstanding. It's housing is made with durable plastic and looks as though could take a beating. The only possible downside is the nozzle, which could come off if twisted too forcefully when putting in certain eartips like Comply. The cable is one of the better ones out there, not to mention it's replaceable. It's Kevlar-reinforced and tangle-resistant with proper strain reliefs on the plug/y-split. The plug is angled but surprisingly, not gold plated. The mic/remote works like it's supposed to.SoundThe IE8 sounds amazing to my ears. The treble is just right, very clear and detailed. The midrange is smooth, really brings the vocals out. The bass is very strong, not muddy but clear and monstrous. It has a bass adjustment knob to please any basshead. Soundstage on this is unreal, the music sounds like it's coming from everywhere. If you're a hip hop music fan, this is a must have. Only thing I noticed when listening to genres other then hip hop, some sounds get overemphasized and makes it seem unnatural. It seems like this was made for listening to hip hop.The VerdictAlthough there are earphones that are more detailed, there is none with the combination of the bass and soundstage of the IE8. I'm in a happy place every time I listen hip hop with these bad boys. These can be had for under $300 and is worth every penny due to the build, replaceable cable, comfort, and sound.
B004836B6M	Sound is great and would love to purchase more.
B004836B6M	My husband and I both agreed that these sounded much better than our cheaper headsets that we have gotten along with our mp3 players.
B004836B6M	These are perfect for me. When I wanna listen to my music at whatever volume, talk hands free while driving, and doing things where I don't have an extra hand to hold the phone. The only downside is my set broke about a month later so I used tape to patch up the job, but it still works.
B004836B6M	Terrible sound. I would not listen to my music on my phone using this headset. At this price, you get what you pay for.
B004836B6M	These headphones work great! They fit in the ear perfectly and deliver great sound quality. I'd definitely recommend them!
B004836B6M	Great sound, comfortable fit. Don't even know they are there. Stays snug even while working out, Plan to buy a pair for my son.
B004836B6M	I enjoyed mine so much that I bought this for my spouse. He uses them when he goes to the store.
B004836B6M	I was hoping to find a headset to leave in my car and purse, because I can never find one when I need one. I purchased two of these and as soon as they were plugged in it was hard to hear sound over the crackling. Ugh if anything touches the connection you hear loads of static. Pass on this waste of money, I will give them to my kids to wear when they play their paper jams guitar.
B004836B6M	Order this item for my husband, he loves music and listening on his iPhone.  He loves it!  I will order more for me and member of my family since all of us have iPhones.  Highly recommending to buy this item.
