B000VIF1B4	Great price and great service.  Very quick delivery.  Would definately buy from this company again.
B000VIF1B4	This little guy is nice. It charges my razr super fast, and there is a transparent Motorola emblem section that lights up blue when it is properly plugged into the lighter thing, so you can always tell out of the corner of your eye without looking down that it is still plugged in. Other car chargers I have purchased take hours and hours to recharge my phone, but this one is fast, as advertised. :)
B000VIF1B4	Exellent charger, charges quickly, inexpensiveMotorola Razr V3, V3i, V3c, Slvr L7, L6, L2 Pebl U6, V190, Mpx200, V360, V323, V325 - Ch710 OEM Original Auto Car Charger Syn0847and looks really cool.
B000VIF1B4	Fit in the accessory socket snugly and never had a problem with it getting a good connection with the phone and charging it. It could have charged faster, but frankly, I always feel that way about phone chargers, so it's not worth taking off a star for. Great price.
B000VIF1B4	Short and sweet reviewIt looks goodIt works goodBuild quality is goodPrice is goodIts just a good charger and worth paying a little more than the generic price. Would recommend and would buy again!
B000VIF1B4	This product works great and as intended. My original Verizon charger failed and cost over $30. This one works the same and substantially cheaper!
B000VIF1B4	The picture of the product has a mini-USB connector; however the car charger that I received has a different connector. Can't be bothered to ship back to get my six bucks back (minus the ship back cost).
B000VIF1B4	It works very well.  I've bought other chargers over the years that work for a while, and then either fade or fall apart.  This is well-made and works.  I'm not sure what more you could ask from it.
B000VIF1B4	I finally have a car charger for my razor that works. Love knowing I can always charge my phone. Works Great and free shipping!
B000VIF1B4	Guess what? it charges the phone (Moto V3). As replacement for the original it will do the job at a decent price.
B000VIF1B4	Used with a RAZR cell phone I purchased for my business.  The phone died within 6 months.  Charger is now a desk drawer ornament.  Worked fine when it was needed.
B000VIF1B4	Works great for past 4 months.  Nice blue glow so you can find it in a dark car.  Bought 2 for me & brother, both going strong.  My wife paid nearly 5 times as much @ local cell store, hers failed in 2 months.  I know @ this price its not real Motorola, but it works great and is a bargain.So I bought a third to replace wife's - it works but doesn't have the cool Blue top, just a little pinpoint LED to indicate power.  Functional, not nearly as fashionable, dimmer glow so harder to see in daylight.  Which one you get must depend on which Chinese factory had a case fall off the truck that week.
B000VIF1B4	This is a well built product and the mini-USB plug is the right size for our V3 RZAR and PEBL phones.  I had one before that lasted seven year of abuse in my truck.
B000VIF1B4	The charger I got with this phone stopped working in a few months...this one is stronger/better built...and I received it in less time that anticipated.
B001T8J6A2	The product worked perfect for the portable DVD player and arrived in a timely manner. I was a very satisfied customer.
B001T8J6A2	This item is great. I bought it when my kids broke the original one after kicking it in the car (not on purpose fortunately).From the beginning I was not very confident in the robustness of the power adaptator.But it lasted 1 year and half and something like 10 long travels.This one it looked really good.The wire is bigger, connection are sturdier and of course it works well.There is even a LED on the power adaptator to show the connection is good.You may think it is useless.Well it is not. Depending on the car you have (I tried several rental cars) it may fit or not.So buy this one ahead of time.No need to wait the original one to stop working.You know it is gonna happen one day and this one is the one you need right now.
B001T8J6A2	Plug works perfectly for my Phillips auto DVD player.  Wish cord was longer. Great service recieved sooner than predicted.
B001T8J6A2	I was nervous when I saw the predicted delivery date was a week after I needed the product, especially when I saw a review that said she received it sooner than expected. I received the product one day after I received the shipping notification. While that might have been because of my location, I apprecaited the fast turnaround.The product worked with my Philips portable DVD player and I am looking forward to having it for our long car trip in a couple weeks.
B001T8J6A2	Not a bad price but I really wish the cord was longer. I have a compact car and the cord barely reaches the cigarette lighter plug-in.
B001TYQ7PS	This car charger fits snugly in our car charger (Honda).  the second socket is to the right of the main one and does not rock when n the the charger cord is inserted.  We can run the portable oxygen machine or charge the phone while driving.  This is a great value.
B001TYQ7PS	works great, and i'm always using both plugs at the same time.  charging my phone, using xm radio, or the gps.  only complaint is that it sticks out sorta far and in my grand am it covers my cup holders.  so it's a little bulky and in the way.  but been using it daily for over a year now and never had a problem.
B001TYQ7PS	It does what it is supposed to do but it sticks out about 2 1/2 inches which will not work in a manual transmission care (too close to the gear shift). Otherwise works great in the automatic. Good price.
B001TYQ7PS	We used this one time and it fell apart. Glad it was cheap because we only got about 10 minutes of use out of it.
B001TYQ7PS	It does exactly what it should do and is compact enough to fit in my center console. You can't beat the price either.
B001TYQ7PS	My son needed this so he could power his GPS and hands-free unit at the same time.He is very pleased that it works and fits his needs.
B001TYQ7PS	Some plugs work fine in it but others need the above fix to make the 12volt appliance work.  I have had other double and triple receptical units that had the same problem.  For the money not bad.
B001TYQ7PS	I chose it to use in the RV so we could plug in more phones and other electronics.  So far it works just fine.
B001TYQ7PS	Two-Way(2 in 1) 12V DC Car Charger Cigar Cigarette Lighter Double Power Adapter Socket Splitter, Black / DUAL SPLITTER / UNIVERSAL by Accessory Wizard for Samsung Memoir SGH-t929The adapter is as described by Amazon on their web site. I'm very happy with it.
B001TYQ7PS	One of my wife's Christmas gifts this year was a car-seat warmer. But due to the fact that my wife is notorious for letting her phone die, I also picked up this splitter and a new car-phone charger. She loves the heated set, and she loves being able to charge her phone. No complaints!In use for only a couple of months & so far no problems. If there are problems down the road I will happily update this review.
B001TYQ7PS	Works great and seem fairly well put together and sturdy. Everything plugs in nice and firm. At ~$2.50 shipped It's a very good deal. I got mine from Tidbits and Pieces.
B001TYQ7PS	FUSE BLEW RIGHT AWAYPACK OF FUSES AT RADIO SHACK COST MORE THAN CHARGERBUT I HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM SINCE
B001TYQ7PS	We were tired of constantly alternating our electronic devices for charging on trips.  This does the trick and didn't cost much $$.
B001TYQ7PS	Doesn't work anymore, I wish I could have went back in time, so I would have never bought it. N
B001TYQ7PS	When you plug it in, sometimes it gets loose and not interrupts my music which i find very annoying but what should I expect for something that cost three bucks right?
B001TYQ7PS	It works great..so far. Hopefully it stays working great. I used to have one just like it but it crapped out after a few weeks.
B001TYQ7PS	I would have given this a 5 star but it is a little loose in the socket not enough to have it fall out or lose power.Will buy again because of overall satisfaction.
B001TYQ7PS	It looks like it's not designed to handle high current draw like a heated seat cover. Only worked for a couple of minutes, melted, blew the fuse and fell apart.
B001TYQ7PS	Works for the moment. Price good. I bought it cause it was what I needed for both my GPS and iPhone charger at the same time.
B001TYQ7PS	I like the item as it works as advertised and expands your power options.  It will provide up to 5 Amps per slot.  I have a Griffin Jolt I use to charge my phone and anything else that needs a USB charger.  Charges as quick as a wall charger. I have an iTrip Bluetooth to aux adapter since my car has no Bluetooth and it provides plenty of power.The only drawback is that the red led for the power indicator is VERY VERY bright and is distracting.  They need to make it some other color and make it a lot more diffused.  At night it is over whelming in the car and is bright enough that you can still see it in direct sunlight.  I am going to put some black epoxy over it to fix it.
B002J79KX0	My hubby is a over the road driver and just loves this keeps everything so nice and neat in the truck.
B002J79KX0	We especially like the retractable cord and east portability. This one replaced a Christmas gift that wasn't compatible with the phone and we like t even more.
B002J79KX0	I bought this charger for my husband who is very happy with the charger.  The retractable cord is great and is much better than the heavy, short coiled cord he had been using.  It easily retracts when not in use, therefore preventing tangles and keeps things neat.  I will be ordering one for myself as well.
B002J79KX0	Nice to have a charger with a retractable cord works fine. Easy to store in glove compartment. My husband keeps it in his pickup.
B002J79KX0	I bought 2 Rubberized Retractable Car Chargers for my wife's Motorola MOTO W755 cell phone. The connector to the phone does not fit at all. Too small. However, I was able to use it for my LG enV2 VX9100 cell phone. The smaller flat connector fits well in this phone. That is why I rated this car charger 3 stars, since it was advertised for the wrong phone. The retractable feature works great. I wished that it had worked for my wife's phone. I have bought other car chargers for the MOTO W755 that either came broken in pieces [cheap], or did not fit like this one, or did not charge the Motorola battery.
B005WWR4FU	Dont buy this company lies. It charges cell phones fine but this thing isn't even close to charging the Bluetooth headset advertisedit takes a docking station not a charger for a droid. This is such a crock in advertising im calling the company back . The only reason its not zero is because it charged my cell phone
B005WWR4FU	This item let me charge my phone in the car and not have cords running the the way of us getting in and out of the care. This item is something we all can use when we have phones that need to be charged.
B005WWR4FU	I bought this charger because it said Motorola elite silver Bluetooth charger but it is just a regular charger, Motorola elite silver needs a special dock. Anyway the company did gave me back my money. but it is my suggestion that please change the title of the product. (take off Motorola elite silver Bluetooth).
B005WWR4FU	I love this, sometimes i am not able to charge my ear piece where i am at, so when i am out and don't need to use it i can leave in the car and charge it up so it will be ready while i am driving.
B005WWR4FU	WORKS GREAT FOR THE CAR. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT. CAN'T ASK FOR MORE.....PRICE IS GOOD. I AM ALWAYS ON THE GO SO I NEED TO KEEP MY BLUETOOTH CHARGED.
B005WWR4FU	The adjustable cord makes this work well for my needs and small enough to store easily.  A decent price for this charger.
B005WWR4FU	This is convenient to take along when I'm on the read - l really love the retractable cord because it doesn't take up any room.
B005WWR4FU	Haven't used it very much but so  far so good! Works like i expected it would it would. I'd recommend it
B005WWR4FU	Was well worth the money I saved.Would recommend to friends.Convenient and easy to use and store when not in use.
B005WWR4FU	Very convienient and functional.  I keep this in the car and am confident it will be ready whenever I need it.
