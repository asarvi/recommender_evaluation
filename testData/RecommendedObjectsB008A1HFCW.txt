B003QINM4O	Fits my phone just the way it is supposed to. Happy that my phone is protected again with a good case...at a fraction of the cost that Apple would charge for one of theirs.
B003QINM4O	Protection. Performance. Price. Marware's SportGrip Edge excels in all.I think the iPhone 4 is perhaps the most impressive piece of technology from Apple Inc. to date; however, it is not without flaws:* I thought the whole "antennagate" issue was hype until I experienced poor call quality while touching the external antenna.* The iPhone 4 is the first mobile device I no longer feel the need to protect the screen from scratches, impacts, and fingerprints; however, this quality makes the iPhone 4 even MORE slippery and easy to drop.In spite of these glaring issues, I still love the iPhone 4 and choose to resolve them (as I had in the past) by purchasing Marware's excellent iPhone cases. The qualities that make these cases the best are hard to find in other models:* PROTECTION - the Marware cases are engineered to reduce impact damage on both the corners AND the screen with precision molding of the polymer material to exacting standards. Unlike the Apple bumper, the Marware case seals the buttons to offer just a little more protection from the elements with little or no reduction in performance.* PERFORMANCE - The case goes on easy, but fits very snugly and doesn't slip. Unlike the silicone material of past models, this case does not attract lint, but still offers far better handling and grip than a naked iPhone (that often feels like a bar of soap just waiting to leap from my hands).* PRICE - $30 for a case?! Really? Prices this high for a case only convey contempt and disdain to Apple customers (I'm looking at you, Apple); dismissing them as vain, frivolous, and gullible to spend an additional 15% above the purchase price of an iPhone on an item that I suspect doesn't even cost the manufacturers 1% (wholesale). Markups these high aren't just annoying, they're insulting. Marware delivers with cases that are closer to the $10 range.At any rate, this case is awesome; perhaps the best ever. Now my iPhone slips into and out of my pocket, but not out of my hand. Perfect.Thanks Marware. I'll be back.
B003QINM4O	I regret being stingy and not reading the product description well and then got this case, which became trash. I don't think it would protect the phone. It is just a cheap plastic ring with the clear stickers.
B003QINM4O	This is thick, rubbery and protective, when face down it keeps space between the screen and whatever as I like. Note: You will not be docking your phone in this, it's too thick, also, it wraps so far around the front that it tends to "catch" the edge of the applied screen/back glass protector and peel the corner (trimming my next one around the edges will fix that so...). a solid buy if you aren't going to dock the phone on something like speakers or clock or whatever, it does not interfere with a standard sync cable so that is not a concern.
B003QINM4O	Case allows you to see iphone and looks like it will protect phone against being dropped. Feels good in your hands. Really like the aesthetics
B003QINM4O	This edge/case is of great quality. It fits snug and it also offers a great design to the phone. I have a white iPhone and it looks GOOD on it. photo 1:[...] photo 2: [...]
B003QINM4O	Bumper works well. I like the lightweight nature of the case. The clear surface protectors provided for the front and back of phone is well appreciated.
B00458PKW6	I got the bright green because I kept losing my phone when it was black......This cover has helped my phone survive MANY drops to the ground with NO damage to the phone or the case. I'll definitely buy one for any new phone I get!
B00458PKW6	My husband is actually slightly offended by how bright a green this cover is. I like it, though. The fit is excellent, it doesn't interfere with the sliding open of the phone, and it just feels durable.
B00458PKW6	I purchased this for my Epic phone; however, it doesn't fit.  I was greatly disappointed.  The seller did offer to take it back; however, it would have cost more to send it back than what I paid for the cover.  The seller was great, the product just didn't work.
B00458PKW6	The color is fine, it just feels cheap and the plastic tabs that hold it to the phone catch. Glad I didn't pay a lot for this phone.
B00458PKW6	This case is really great. It fit my phone perfectly and is the perfect bright neon color. I got exactly what I wanted. Also, the price is unbeatable. Try buying a phone case in the mall for under $20. Overall, a great product and I am very happy.
B00458PKW6	The color of this is definitely more of a bright yellow, which I still like and almost expected because of the other reviews. I'm happy with the quality.  Much better than a few others that I have paid $20+ for.  It snaps on and off easily and without breaking and does not interfere with the keyboard.
B00458PKW6	When this phone case came in, it wasn't the color I was expecting.. but, it's pretty much going to look a little different on every screen you view it on.  With that being said, the quality of the case is GREAT and the price is even better.  I usually pay $10(plus tax) per case at my local phone case store and this is pretty much the exact same item for a third of the price. As long as the service is good, I will continue purchasing my phone cases from here.
B00458PKW6	This phone case is so cute,and bright! no damage and fast shipping. It is very durable,andeasy to take off and on. There is not too much more I can say about this product except that it does do the trick. If I had to I would buy again.
B00458PKW6	I bought this case for my wife's phone and she loves it. It fits perfectly and was a great deal!
B00458PKW6	Color matched picture. However, smelled like chemical paint and was not "Rubberized" at all, just a hard case. There's nothing wrong with the case, just can't stand the smell and wanting a more rubbbr-feel...I sent back..
B00458PKW6	This product was true to it's description and the color is spot on with the picture. Seems very durable and the fit is amazing. Does not interfere with the sliding keyboard or any other buttons or functions.
B00458PKW6	Fits nice and tight on my phone, and protects it very well. Much better than the plastic cover that I had previously.
B00458PKW6	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 good
B00458PKW6	works well. Held color. nice texture. Minimal protection against impact/dropping. Doesn't get stuck pulling it out of pocket. Cool case.
B00458PKW6	Love it! Snapped on very easily and is brilliant neon green. Can't lose this one! Much sturdier than the one I originally purchased from the Sprint store. That one kept falling off the phone and was attached with some sort of thin two sided tape. Really?
B00458PKW6	I was completely unhappy when I got this in the mail . I was suposedx to be a neon green and it looks light yellow no where close to neon green. And to top it off I can't return it. Very unsatisfied.
B00458PKW6	This isnt the best case I have had for my phone, but it does the job and fits better than most cases out there for the epic. I won't say that the fit is perfect but it is pretty good, and you really cant beat the price. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00458PKW6	Bought this for my Granddaughter.  She loved the color and is very happy with it.  It was easy for her to attach to her phone.
B00458PKW6	Love it!!!  Great color, took me a second to fit it and now fits great.  Haven't dropped it yet with the cover on so not sure if it will stay in place but will update once dropped.  Not made quite as pictured.  Does not have cut out for bottom menu selection, it's just open, which is no problem at all.
B00458PKW6	it arrived when promised. Seems to work fine. Whe changing batteries, it is a little awkward to remove how ever.
B00458PKW6	I bought this case a few weeks ago for my daughter's phone. The phone fell off the banister and the case popped right off and the screen shattered when it hit the floor. I'm so dissapointed that this hard skin case cover did not protect the phone at all.
B00458PKW6	This case fits my phone perfectly and I love the color. My only issue is how easily it gets dirty, colors are easily rubbed onto it.
B00458PKW6	This item is made of green plastic vs painted plastic as many similar products. I had several painted plastic covers previously, and all of them would fade after few weeks. Hopefully, this one will be green till it breaks.
B00458PKW6	After about 9 months of use this case is no longer staying clipped together reliably.  Since it's being used by a 14 y/o boy, I'd say that's probably to be expected.
B00458PKW6	I have a D700 phone, and the cover fits great.  Good seller and prompt service.  Color is an apple-type green, and looks really nice.  Thank you.
B00458PKW6	The color is awesome, the feel is secure, the fit is superb.  I would recommend this case to anyone who likes this color and you can't beat the price!
B00458PKW6	Great product! The one I had initially broke, and I also wanted one that stood out from the depths of my purse. This one is perfect for me.
B00458PKW6	Item got to me 7 days before promised which was a surprise. A decent case for the cost, good fit, should work well for the purpose I ordered it for. Thanks!
B00458PKW6	I received the case it looked great when I put it on  but the color has began to fade already after a few months.
B00458PKW6	The product is great, but I've dropped my phone a couple of time since I had it on there and it definitely protects my phone, but when I drop it the entire backing of the phone and th case pop off. And its not necessarilly rubber s much as soft plastic.I still love it though!
B00458PKW6	It was very inexpensive, that's why I do not mind it cracking after a few weeks, or may be days. I had to take out the cover to replace batteries, and sd card and such. It just cracked after a few uses. Good looks, bright, easy to find in my purse, but not sturdy.
B00458PKW6	i would reccommend this phone case. I've been using it for months and i drop my phone all of the time. this has always saved it and it has not cracked or broken at all!
B00458PKW6	Only the backside stay on my phone the front part wont fit! Other than that it really a cute color.
B00458PKW6	I wanted a case to keep my phone safe from scratches and bumps but didn't want to spend a ton of money. This works great for me fit like a glove and the price was nice. I will say after a 3 months or so some of the paint started to come off around scratches and one of the tabs broke off but the thing still holds on fine and has saved my phone numerous times so I would definitely buy it again.
B00458PKW6	This case started breaking apart within 6 weeks of use.  I ended up having to toss it, because it wouldn't stay on my phone.
B00458PKW6	This product was exactly what I was looking for, great color, durable and the price was very good it arrived fast! :-)
B0048OIB2I	Fun way to dress up your cell,while protecting it.I bought this for my daughter & with kids,you have to make things fun while protecting them aswell.
B004WPHC0K	Pros: This skin is REALLY tough and provides excellent shock absorbancy, it was well packaged and fairly easy to install, and holds almost no fingerprintsCons: The surface of this protector is quite soft, it's more elastic than a hard surface. If it sits in your pocket with ANYTHING with edges (e.g. a bluetooth headset, coins, buttons, etc. forget keeping keys near it) it puts a marking indentation on the surface that fades somewhat, but doesn't seem to go away completely. You can scratch it with your fingernail.Conclusion: If you need something to protect the screen from impacts, this would most likely be your choice!....if you're needing something to keep it from scratching, this is not a good option for you.
B004WPHC0K	This is so far the best fitting screen protector I applied to my G2x.The fit is just perfect.That's attention to detail.That's quality control.Other skin guards come close, but none like Skinomi.Other Considerations:Orange Peel: Nothing significant if instructions are followed. From personal experience I can say that if you notice a lot of orange peel then you probably used too much of the application solution. This is true for all wet-applied screen protectors.Effect on screen clarity: Minimal. I only notice the difference when I compared my G2x+Skinomi with my wife's without.
B004WPHC0K	Protects the screen like it's meant to, although the bubbles which form took literally a couple of weeks to go away, and they're still at the bottom of the screen, threatening to pull the whole thing off every so often. That said, it's clear, stays on, and does what it's meant to do. The one major inconvenience is that you have to leave your phone off for 24 hours when first putting it on, so you need to find a time to do when you don't expect to need your phone. Good luck with that.
B004WPHC0K	Without a doubt the Skinomi TechSkin is a strong screen protector. It is very easy to apply granted you follow the instructions. Make sure you turn the device off and allow it to dry! However, there are several flaws with this product, while it did provide a decent amount of protect for my phone it is not as scratch resistant as claimed.  To test the skin I scratched it with a key and immediately left scratches. Minimal pressure was applied yet the results were the same. (It is a great protector but just not as good as claimed.) Furthermore, the product adds a decent amount of thickness in terms of a screen protector to your phone and slightly reduces screen sensitivity.  I was a huge fan of the TechSkin until just about two days ago (I had the product for almost two months) the screen protector just peeled off. The product was good enough for me to be satisfied initially, but the recent failure initiated this review. To other G2x users...you get what you pay for; also the G2x had Gorilla Glass so the screen protector is overkill.
B004WPHC0K	I had a KlearKare screen protector before this one and I have to say it is way better. KlearKare didn't fit properly and was a pain in the butt to install. Skinomi fit perfectly and was way easier to install. My previous phone had the ZAGG protector on it, but I hated the orange peel effect/feel. Skinomi doesn't have it at all. The only problem is the indentations left behind when scratch as someone has stated, but it is still a way better product than KlearKare
B004WPHC0K	I must say this screen protector is performing well.  After 4-5 months, the edges stay down nicely and collect very little dust.  The screen protector does have some fine scratches over the surface but are not visible while the screen is on.  The application is a bit challenging if you are perfectionist.As for the company, I must say that the customer service is great.  The item shipped very quickly (few days) after ordering and the initial product had a few flaws in it.  I contacted the company by email and they sent a replacement immediately at no charge.  Nice to see someone stand by their product.Hints for installation.  Clean the screen surface with a little bit of water and a lint free cloth.  Then wash your hands with soap and water.  Soak up the screen with the spray on both sides and then soak up your hands (both) with the spray.  Place the film on and with all that moisture, it should slide around easily for positioning.  When you are ready, re soak the top of the film and use the squeegee to gently press out any bubbles.  I find that this extra soaking helps prevent the scratching that might occur on the film during the squeegee process.  Fine pinpoint bubbles actually work them selves out magically.  I had massive amounts of pin point bubbles everywhere and the film is actually perfect all the way through.I would recommend this to anyone.
B004WPHC0K	Skin covers pretty much the entire face of the G2X so  you'll need to cut it down if you use a protective phone case (& who doesn't?). After following the instructions & waiting the recommended time for the skin to "settle" I was not happy to watch my slick new skin crimp & buckle at the edges once I slipped my Seidio SURFACE case onto the phone. Pulled the skin up & trimmed it down with an X-ACTO but re-application did the thing in. Skin surface is visibly, permanently dented/scratched just from using the included plastic smoothing-card that 2nd time & I never even got to properly use & abuse the darn thing. Trim it down & get it right the 1st time & MAYBE you could consider this worth the trouble, but I think I'm gonna go for a cheaper, more simple option from now on
B004WPHC0K	I give this product an A.  I really searched and searched for a product with good reviews and it's funny how there's very few products out there with 4-5 stars.  I think some people gave this one some unfavorable remarks, too, but overall it had a good score.For me, I give a 5 star.  It was easily to apply.  The direction/instruction with the product was RIGHT ON.  When it states that the micro-bubbles and imperfection will go away in 2-3 days... it's absolutely true!  When I first put it on... I seriously had some doubts.  As careful as I was... there were certainly "bubbles and imperfection" very obvious.  I almost resorted to a needle to "pop" the bubbles.  But I refrained... and sure enough, within 1-2 days, I can see that a significant part of the bubbles and imperfections were going away fast.  With 3 days... it was flawless.Just follow the instruction very closely and you'll love this product.I've had it now for over 2 weeks... still going good... feels great to the touch and screen response.  There's a real supple feel to it.
B004WPHC0K	Love this screen protector for me g2x.  Go to you tube and watch a video on how to install.  If you follow the directions you are going to be amazed at how great this protector looks on your phone.  Cannot even tell its there.  Highly recommended.
B004WPHC0K	This is a great screen protector. Very solid and easy to install. As the manufacturer says, initial air pockets will dissapear with time.
B004WPHC0K	I was really excited about ordering this screen protector as I saw many great reviews. Installation was pretty simple and easy to follow and the screen looked great at first and then after 24 hours there was some major orange peel effect going on and it did not go away. So after 4 days I contacted customer service, and they were very nice about the situation. They offered me a replacement with no additional costs. So with this next one, it was a whole lot better than the first but after a week I saw a scratch and that wasn't going away. The product said it was scratch resistant but clearly it wasn't. I wanted my money back but I had to send in the whole product and I decided not too since I only got it for $7. Customer service gave me another replacement and officially I have given up. At first it looked great but as the days pass by there is more and more orange peel and scratches and dents made by my nails. So now I am on the hunt for a better screen protector.
B004WPHC0K	I've applied a few of these and this one was no different. In a word: wonderful!It's durable and easy to install. It took a few days to work out all the bubbles, and there is one tiny area on the curved corner that wont stick (I suppose it may be a problem later) but with the lifetime warranty and past great experience with the product, I'm not worried.This is much better than the cheapo protectors. You spent a bunch of money on a nice phone, go ahead and spend the money to protect it.
B004WPHC0K	This is my second Skinomi screen protector and I must say it has never let me down. The material gives your screen a ridiculous amount of protection (I have actually done the whole key thing...not even a mark!) and it also improves the feel of your phone.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it takes quite a while to set right on your phone (I put mine on Friday night, it's still working out the little bubbles and what-not and it's Sunday morning) And you have to apply it VERY CAREFULLY or it will leave smudges all over it and they will NOT go away. You also need to keep your phone off for 12-24 hours, so it's not a "stick it on and go" kind of thing.Overall this is a great screen protector and I would recommend it to anyone.
B004WPHC0K	I'm sure this product works well once it is installed. The installation process took way to much time and effort.I need a product that installs with very little  time involved. Thats not the fault of the product however, it is something to consider when purchasing. The product was delivered before expected and the packaging was worth an award. Very nice!
B004WPHC0K	this was a great product although it is a bit sticky like when running your fingers through it. Great quality though and really protects my g2x.
B004WPHC0K	Great screen protector that seems to smooth itself after being scratched.  Easy to clean and appears very durable.  Fast shipper.
B006ZD0O4I	I bought this case risking it might be good or bad, when I got the case I loved the color! It is cute, but it fits a bit big and it doesn't have an opener to charge the phone, that gets kind of annoying having to take the case off every time I wanna charge it. The back is a very thin of rubber
B006ZD0O4I	It's a sturdy, not perfectly fitting (but not too bad) iPhone case that makes your phone look like a cassette... ahhhhh cute!All the ports and buttons function fine, you can charge it, adjust your volume etc.As you can see from the photo, you can see the Apple logo a bit with the case on, so for the full on cassette tape affect I put a little piece of black paper behind that hole and down to the last detail is looks like I cassette. I own one in every color. I'm in love.I find there's a slight variation and fit in quality to each one I own, so I suspect some of the negative reviews may have received lesser quality cases, but the 4 I own are all decent but not excellent as far as protection goes. It's not an Otter Box- it's a cute cassette tape case that cost you a couple dollars. Don't use it if you're going to be going on a rigorous hike with your phone, a beach trip (well I do, but I live on the edge) etc., just accept it's cute and not a device of extreme protection.
B006ZD0O4I	It is a cool looking case, also very funny!!! but, it is just a thin layer of rubber. Also, the camera lens hole is small, so, that's is not good.
B006ZD0O4I	Love the color. Love the look. Fits great on the phone. I gave this 4 stars because I have to take the case off to charge it. I bought the purple one and did not have to take the case off. There is no slot for the charge on the organic case. Not sure if its a manufacturer defect or if that's how it it. Make a slot on the bottom for the charger and I. Sure people will rate it 5 stars.
