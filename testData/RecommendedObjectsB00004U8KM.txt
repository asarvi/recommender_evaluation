B000GM50DO	Touble getting signal to cell phone at times. Price was right and it feels comfaortably to use.
B000GM50DO	I purchased this bluetooth as a christmas gift for my bfriend-because I already owned one. It works great, long lasting, and for the price, you just can't beat it, I would recommend this bluetooth to everyone!
B000GM50DO	The first bluetooth was not working properly and I did the complaint,at two days I got the new bluetooth...WOW!!!! what a service!!!!
B000GM50DO	works great, price right...just a little loose on your ear if you are moving around a lot.
B000GM50DO	Lots of static sometimes. Not loud enough. Not as good as the cheapy I lost.
B000GM50DO	The Motorola H350 bluetooth headset is one of the cheaper models out there, and it shows.PAIRINGThe H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets.  Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds.  Your phone finds the H350 and you hit "ok."  This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset.  I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.COMFORT/DESIGNThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear.  The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes.  Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset.  I definitely cannot say that about the H350.  The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal.  There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.SOUND QUALITYI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare.  Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different.  People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little "far-away."  I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing).  When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up.  This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity.  As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.OVERALLAt it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works.  You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset).  However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked.  I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price.  If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.
B000GM50DO	I bought this to replace my other one (same model). I lost my other ones and got this one for half the price. The only problem that i have is that i found my old one that was missing for months in my couch. So now i have two. Fast shipping.
B000GM50DO	When I first looked for this product in google, it said that the price was 12.99, but when I actually went to the amazon website it was 12.00 more....still cheaper than the actual cellphone place, but I would have liked to have been told the real price upfront.
B000GM50DO	I bought this one for my husband because I bought one for myself and he always wanted one of this brand.He likes his very much. It is easy to connect to the phone. He has a Motorola Razr. The reception is great. The calls are very clear. Most calls are static-free. He works at the Post Office and something in the building structure wiring (?) causes some of his calls to me to be choppy but he says he can hear me very clearly. He likes it better than the previous headset we had from Jabra.He does not have the same complaints that I have  He doesn't have a problem with the fit. He claims to not have to hold it on his ear to hear more clearly. He does agree that it seems to drain the power from itself and phone more quickly and has to be charged more frequently than if you didn't use the headset.  He is very satisfied with this product.
B000GM50DO	I purchased this as a replacement for one just like it. I love it. Easy to use and cost effective.
B000GM50DO	i enjoy the comfort of this type of ear piece. i don't like the ear pieces that stick in my ear.
B000GM50DO	This is a great headset if you have issues with in ear devices. The clarity is great, pairing is easy, the reversibility from one ear to the other is a plus and the blinking blue light can be disabled. Just don't move your head around too quickly. Great for the money but I eventually moved on to a more expensive Plantronics Voyager Pro headset.
B000GM50DO	This product works great. It comes with full instructions on how to get it working with your cellphone. Several other companies don't include the full instructions so you have more guess work involved with setting it up. I would highly recommend getting the Motorola H350.Motorola H350 Bluetooth Headset - Black
B000GM50DO	I was very happy with the seller and the product. This was the second time I had ordered this product from the seller. I had ordered one for my husband and so pleased with the product and service I ordered one for myself. The Motolola blue tooth was what I was looking for. The seller was prompt with shipping and I recieved the product in a timely manner. I will order more products from this seller in the future.
B000GM50DO	I've had this headset for about 9 months.  The only reason it has taken me this long to replace it is a lack of money. It has been driving me crazy the whole 9 months. Here's why:1. To connect to my phone via the bluetooth I have to turn it on then turn it off, then turn it on again.  Sometimes I have to repeat this two or three times.  (It's not the phone.  I've checked.)2. When I voice dial sometimes it doesn't transmit what I say correctly.  Ex: I say "work" to call my office.  It confirms "Brian" and calls my friend.  (Again, not the phone.  I've checked.)3. It's so loose on my ear that I have to hold it tight to my head so I can hear.  So much for hands free.  And I often have to cup my hand over the microphone and my mouth so I can be heard.  I might as well hold the phone!Really don't bother getting this one.  It's a waste of money.
B000GM50DO	I have had this bluetooth ear piece for at least 2 years. It is durable. I drop it all the time and it is still going strong. It is light weight, so it doesn't bother you too much for long conversations. The battery lasts a long time, after several years of use, the battery still goes several days between charges (with a couple hours of conversation and the rest of the time on standby, takes approx 2 hours to charge fully).I use it with a T-Mobile Dash phone. It is easy to pair up and the initial code for set up is 1234. Before this phone, I used it with a Razor. It connected well with both phones. Occasionally, you have to turn the ear piece on and off a few times before the phone finds it and connects, don't know if that is an issue with my phone, the ear piece, or just bluetooth in general.I'm surprised the price has not dropped at all for this item (although I can understand why as it is a quality product). I bought it 2+ years ago at a Sam's Club for $25.Another Pro about this item is that it is easily interchangeable between left and right ear, so if you get tired of having it on one side during a long drive, you could easily flip it to the other side quickly (even while in the middle of a conversation!)I highly recommend this item.
B000GM50DO	I guess can't expect too much for that price.As I'm using the wireless headset, it makes some weird noises and makes it hard for the other person to hear you.I wonder if I can have a new one sent by the salesperson at no cost and that way I'll feel satisfied.
B000MTEFIC	The performance of this headset is disappointing. I originally ordered it because my Moto headset (HS850) seemed to have low volume when used with the Blackberry 8830 (the HS850 didn't have this problem when used with a Moto V710 phone). I figured since the HS 655 was optimized for Blackberry by Plantronics, it would be the best choice. Reviews rated the Plantronics version highly. My experience: Comfort and fit was fine. Features and operation also fine, although it lacks the ability to switch between calls during Call Waiting. Volume for me was excellent (solved my original problem) but people consistently complained about the sound quality on their end - lots of noise, static, etc. The headset was never more than about 2 feet from the phone (same side of body) so range wasn't the problem. I called my own office voicemail to record the sound quality from various locations during my commute and confirmed the poor performance. Switching back to the Moto HS850 got rid of the problem, so I figure the phone is ok.This one's going back. Maybe it's just a defective unit, but I'm done with this model. The hunt for a decent Bluetooth headset continues...**UPDATE**I ordered a Plantronics Voyager 510 based on the high marks so many reviewers gave it. It had the same noise problem as the HS 655 (crackles, etc) on the receiver's end when paired with the Blackberry 8830! Now I figured the phone was at fault. After playing with a couple of settings, I found that the encryption setting was causing the problem (Bluetooth setup -> highlight the device ->select "Device Properties" -> set Encryption to "Disabled"). With encryption disabled, the problem is gone. So probably the HS 655 was fine all along. The 510 may still be a better choice since it has a noise cancelling microphone while the 655 does not, but the style is definitely "old school."(It's puzzling that RIM didn't make sure the HS 655 was fully compatible with their own phone, or at least put something in the headset instructions to disable the encryption feature. Then again, they had really poor documentation that came with the product: a quick start guide that didn't even describe how to change ear buds (3 sizes provided) or how to mount the ear clip that came in the package. They did have a card that directed you to their website for more info, but there wasn't anything more descriptive there either. I had to go to Plantronics web site to get the more complete user guide for their 655.)
B000MTEFIC	received the Blackberry HS 655 shortly after ordering it online, at a great price by the way..good packaging, came with the instruction pamphlet including charging directions and device functionality.i read thru those materials and charged it overnight.Been using this product for about a month, every day. I have been using Blackberry phones for about 5 years now and this HS 655 is far and away the best Bluetooth headshet I have used.3 ear pieces came in the packge. I selected one that fits my ear very comfortably. easy instructions to enable as Bluetooth with my phone. worked the first time through.very lightweight, hardly noticeable in the ear. I keep it in my ear for extended periods of time throughout the day as I drive around the city. 3 hours long is not uncommon.Reception is clear, "crystal"!! clear!a soft impress answers the phone and ends the conversation. volume adjustments work very well. I keep the case clipped to my pants pocket at times so that way it is handy for storgage when not in my ear.Having used as many as 1/2 dozen other headsets over the last few years, nothing compares to this one...I did initial researach on the Internet to check out other reviews and the consensus of the product.It definitely meets and exceeds my expectations!!Blackberry did "good" with this one..I highly recommend it for other Blackberry users. small,lightweight, comfortable, and terrific reception!!
B000MTEFIC	I purchased this item for use with my blackberry pearl. Since I received the item I have been hearing complaints from people with whom I talk using the headset that there is TONS of static coming from me to them. I thought maybe it was just a break-in period but its been almost a month and nothing changed. I will attempt to return it now.
B000MTEFIC	I use this product daily. The volume control is amazing. I have issues hearing certain tone levels, and this is the first headset (I have tried 4 previously) that has enough volume so that I can hear any caller, regardless of the tone level in their voice. The gel earpieces are very comfortable as well. Very reliable product.
B000MTEFIC	This product is incredibly ergonomic, you won't notice you have it on.  Excellent sound quality and wireless range.  Battery life is great!.  It will vibrate if you have it on it's holster and will close the call if you put it there.  I really have no complaints about it.
B000MTEFIC	This is a nice little device.  It only stays in my ear securely by using the wire piece that goed behind my ear.  The sound quality is good, but not outstanding.  There is some jitter to the sound even when only 6 feet away from the phone or if the phone is on the other side of my body from the headset.  BEST thing is that background noises are significantly reduced so that the headset can be used in semi-noisy environments.  Way to go Plantronics!
B000MTEFIC	Range it's a huge problem with this device. My Dash is in my pouch attached to my belt most of the time but as soon as I increase the 2 feet range I'm in trouble. Sound quality doesn't even metter cause you never get to experience it unless your phone is within two feet. Batery? well another dissapointment. My last motorola headset lasted about a week compared to max two days with this one. However... very stylish! Don't buy it! Very disappointed!
B000MTEFIC	Reception is clear. Spoken words are easily understood. Light weight and comfortable. Some people may require the ear loop for the headset to sit comfortably in their ear. Nice touch with the capability to recharge the device with a AAA battery in the holster. Doesn't appear to be able to be paired with 2 cell phones (different manufacturer) at the same time.
B000MTEFIC	I was somewhat dissapointed by this device especially that is has been branded by Blackberry. I was expecting a lot more. They advertise the device being functional upto 30 feet away from your phone, if I walk about more than 5-7 feet, voice quality starts detioriating rapidly.While using it when driving, I have had 50-50 positive and negative responses from the other end. Some people tell me that it is just too loud and that it is picking up all the noise around me. Other says, it sounds like you are just talking on a cell phone (which is what I would at least expect it to do).Controling the button to switch off and on, pick up an incoming call,  and ending a call isnt the greatest. It doesnt work like they would intend it to. At times I push the button to pick up a call, it does nothing. So I have to revert to my phone to answer the call.Overall it is an acceptable device, I don't use it heavily except when driving.I will certainly keep my eyes open for other devices out there. I would highly recommend against buying it if you are buying it because it is branded "Blackberry". It is a mediocore device by my standards.
B000MTEFIC	I have a blackberry pearl and this bluetooth headset works well with my phone. Feedback from friends and family indicate that they can hear me much clearer than on my previous bluetooth headset(Motorola H505). It took a little getting used to (it's really small!) but I am happy with the purchase. The carrying case makes this a must have for me!
B000MTEFIC	Product worked well in most situations.  But for a device supposedly designed for a BlackBerry, I wasn't impressed.  Its audio seems to break up on some calls and makes it difficult for the person on the other end to follow you in a conversation.  I have had several other Plantronic bluetooth products and bought this one thinking I would get the same if not improved BlackBerry phone performance.  I didn't.
B000MTEFIC	I have a bit of problem hearing these things so I was pleasantly surprised at the  listening volume of the HS 655.I've owned Motorola, Sony-Erricson, Jabra and Cardo-Scala headset, they are all sitting in  my desk drawer, collecting dust. They were just too quiet.Another nice feature is the charger is the same fitting as my RZR, a mini USB.
B000MTEFIC	I bought it and used with my blackberry curve.  It works great...the device is slim and light and fits into your ear perfectly.  The only thing is that you need to make sure to keep it clean all the time.
B000MTEFIC	Casing needs to cover the ear sponge as well for protection. The sponge part keeps falling out - needs to be glued on or the fit needs to be improved from the factory. I solved this by twisting the sponge all the way to the right (or left depending on the ear you are using it in). I think the casing needs to be more protective. The top part, including the ear piece, protrudes from the top of the case and, in a purse or pocket, causes the earpiece sponge to come off. I also have the ear bracket attached and, when the sponge comes off - that does too. Try digging through the bottom of your purse for that and the ear piece! AND, I still get complaints about ambient noises, even though this was one of their selling points!!!!
B000MTEFIC	Overall pretty good product the charging cradle bites as you have to have it with you. I don't know why all the bluetooth's can't use a common charging tip.
B000MTEFIC	This little bludtooth actually was run over by a car and except for a few scratches works fine.  Volume is great.  This is a must-buy.  It is great quality and well-designed.
B000MTEFIC	Pros: Lightweight, small, great sound quality, extremely comfortable.Cons: Static if you wear on the opposite side of body from your phone (ie, earpiece in right ear, but BlackBerry in left pocket or holster on left-side of body)
B000MTEFIC	Had 2 jawbones, both junk.  Bought this & found it to be vastly superior, even though noise cancellation would be a nice addition, it's not necessary with this headset.
B000MTEFIC	I recently purchased this headset and am very pleased with it.  It came with 3 sizes of urethane earpieces so I found one that fits snugly in my ear.  The headset is so small and light I do not need to use the supplied wire loop.  Sound is loud and clear thanks to the earpiece.  The holster idea is great- it vibrates when a call is coming in and the earpiece automatically answers the phone as soon as I remove it from the holster.  Someone complained about the reception- I experienced poor reception too, at first.  I have a Blackberry Pearl and in the Options/Security Options/General Settings, I found a setting for Bluetooth Signal Strength.  The default is the lowest setting.  I had to enable password protection to change this setting, but once changed, I could disable the password protection again.  Now, my headset operates clearly up to about 20 feet from my phone.
B000MTEFIC	I HAVE HAD MORE THAN ONE OF THESE.ON DIFFERENT MODEL PHONES.NO PROBLEMS
B000MTEFIC	This headset is almost weightless and extremely comfortable. The reception is very good. The only drawback is that occasionally it has to be reconnected to my cell phone. It is not necessary to go through the whole pairing process, but it still takes time.  The other drawback is that my Blackberry 8830 seems to crash whenever I try to answer a conference call with the headset on. This may be a problem with the phone and not the headset.  The Plantronics 510 holds the connection much more reliably and has excellent reception, but it is heavier and not quite as comfortable.
B001OFY6MS	fit to the ear is not great.But connectivity is great. volume is not bad. Noise cancellation is good too.
B001OFY6MS	Replaced my Moto H721 (crap) with Moto H15. I prefer bluetooths that rest on side of ear vs. in ear.  I liked everything except it would constantly slide out of ear canal even with ear hook. I spent more time adjusting to get it to stay in my ear. Purchased small ear cushions to help solve problem but to no avail. It continues to get loose and slide out of ear. Want to try Moto H17 but I've noticed that it goes in ear also.  Probably will go back to using the bluetooth that rest on side of ear like my Moto H710.
B001OFY6MS	I've had the Motorola H15 headset for about 9 months and have used it with both a Blackberry and iPhone 3GS. I previously owned the Jabra Gen 1 earpiece, which was good. This earpiece is excellent in every respect, including noise cancelling. My only complaint, as with the Jabra was that it's tough to get a good fit in the ear.
B001OFY6MS	It is a good product but could fit the ear a little more comfortably while keeping it from falling out.
B001OFY6MS	I previously bought this product from ATT and it cost me 3 times as much as I paid for it on Amazon.  The same exact product.  The plastic hook broke on the first one and I could not find a replacement, so I ordered another bluetooth.  I found the hearing mechanism worked better with the one I ordered from Amazon. I received the bluetooth within a few days of ordering it, packaged in excellent condition.  Why pay triple for the same product?
B001OFY6MS	Better than Blue ANT Voice Activated Headset. Better than Plantronics 835. Folding Boom Mic very Convenient. My Favorite Bluetooth. My friends no longer ask me to repeat myself.
B001OFY6MS	I was thrilled with this bluetooth when I got it. After about a month I couldnt get it to work correctly. I have tried everything I can think of to see if I wasnt charging it correctly or pairing it with my phone correctly but I have let others try it with their phones and it just doesnt work. All I get now when I turn it on is a loud beeping noise in my ear that gets lower and lower within 10 seconds and then just quits. Cant answer calls or anything.
B001OFY6MS	My husband is quite happy with this particular headset. Setup was easy and its compact look is stylish. He likes that it fits comfortably over his ear but it doesn't fit quite well within the ear so sometimes it just hangs there.
B001OFY6MS	Its a pretty good bluetooth. but I would not recommend it to anyone. The mic is clear but you have to project your voice pretty well for others to hear The speaker is also clear but low. the "crystal talk" doesnt stand up too well with this headset. The  earpiece  doesnt hold very snug .The only 2 real advantages to this headset is the great docking port, and the microphone book that flips to instantly connect. I gave the H15 away to someone who didnt have one. I am looking to get the H17 instead.Ive heard many good things about it. I am hoping to get it soon when the price goes under 50 bucks.Not recommended
B001OFY6MS	I've ended up buying four of these bluetooth headsets for self and friends.  Callers come through loud and clear and can hear me clearly as well.Great feature is the ability to handle two phones.  I turn the bluetooth on in the morning and it automatically jumps onto both of my Nokia phones in seconds.It is a little bulky compared to other bluetooths but performs much better.  I have tried most other brands and this one tops them all.
B001OFY6MS	Better than Blue Ant or any LG I've ever owned.  It is the clearest sound ever - for me and for those I'm talking with.  And the ease of use with the flip on and off is awesome ... you get spoiled!  In addition it's the most comfortable bluetooth every.  I love it.  LOVE it!!
B001OFY6MS	It didn't last long for a blue collar worker (husband is a truck driver). Sweating from working in excessive heat caused it to short out after 8 weeks.
B001OFY6MS	This headset is perfect in every way except what it is meant to do. It is lightweight, easy to use, comfortable, great battery life, but the person on the other end of the line can never hear me! I am always told that it sounds like I am in a deep tunnel, and my voice fades in and out. I was very excited to use this headset after reading the great reviews on Amazon, but alas it appears their quality is inconsistent for this model.In the interest of full disclosure, I feel obliged to mention that I bought this headset refurbished from [...]
B001OFY6MS	I thought it would be great to purchase a noise canceling headset and wanted to stick with the Motorola line due to previous good experience with many other flip-to-use BT headsets.Noise canceling aside, I was less than thrilled with having something sit in my ear.Turns out that I did not have to worry about where the headset ear-piece (speaker) sits as the completely attached and very fragile over-the-ear clip broke the first time I put the headset in a roomy compartment of my laptop bag.  Now I have a useless headset.Time-to-failure: 1 weekIf you are active, if you might put this headset in a pants or coat pocket or in a bag compartment, if you might place this headset anywhere else than in some carrying case or on your ear, then I suggest looking at a different headset.  The clear over-the-ear clip is completely attached to the headset.  If it breaks, there is no replacing it.  Even more, the broken part might be painfully sharp and should be considered a design flaw.I liked the headset, sort of, while it worked.  I never warmed to the idea of having an ear-piece in my ear, but I certainly did not expect the ear-clip to break while doing the exact same thing I have done over the past 6 years with all of my other many headsets.  Even worse, I did not expect the broken ear-clip to poke me (drawing blood) when I attempted to retrieve the headset without looking.As far as audio was concerned, everyone sounded tinny all the time.
B001OFY6MS	The H15 is one of the best bluetooth headsets I have owned. I love the cradle for charging, and the ease of connecting it to your phone, and use.It's lightweight to the point you will almost forget that you have it on. The H15 is also easy to wear with glasses if you must.
B001OFY6MS	I purchased this Headset to replace another Motorola headset that I had. Initially I was very happy with the product. I bought this headset because it could connect to 2 phones at once. It does do that. However it is very erractic in its connections. Sometimes my Blackberry would just not sync up. I upgraded my Blackberry and it also had a similar problem. The voice quality is ok although it could have been a bit louder. My biggest problem however with this headset is battery life. The headset just dies after 2-3 hrs of talk time. I am going back to my old trusted H710.
B001OFY6MS	Ok, does not fall off your ear fits snuggly. I can hear people very clearly. But when you have a table fan going people can not hear. Everyone is telling me this when I am in a room with the table fan on. To me it does not let you talk for 4 hours. I have to recharge all the time but it charges fast...So even though they say its the best product out there, to each its own.
B0024FA6QW	I tried one for a little over a week.  I wanted something that I could use in my car for hands free.  Pairing with my blackberry 8830 was easy.  Although I wasn't interested in the earbud I can safely say is too large to use in your ear.  Speaker was clear but volume was a bit too loud, easily fixed with the buttons, but unfortunately it doesn't retain the volume settings when you switch it off.  Someone noted that the buttons are a bit too close together and impossible to see at night - I completely concur.  The microphone worked pretty well - most people said they could hear me clearly but with the obvious speakerphone sound.  I ended up returning it for two reasons: 1) the battery life was not very good.  A few days of of may be 3 hours total usage and it needed to be recharged.  2) I ended up hanging up calls and making calls because pressing the buttons was problematic.
B0024FA6QW	IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT YOU CAN HEAR CRYSTAL CLEAR, CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU'RE ON SPEAKER FONE
B0024FA6QW	LG  HBM-800 Bluetooth Mono Headset with Speakerphone and Charging CradleGreat product. I like it very much which the earbud was a little smaller then it would fit perfectly in the ear without the over the ear clip but for uniqueness of it tahat a small set back.
B0024FA6QW	I wanted this kind of set for a long time, and I looked high and low for it. I will say, it works.Good things:-It is loud and clear.-It does the trick while your driving.Not great things:-Each time you get in and out of the car (unless your going to wear the earbud part in wherever your going), you have to turn each part on. It would be easier if it was one button to turn on both. Also, each piece you have to hold down the on/off button for 5 seconds each, each time you get in or out of your car. I do realize I'm complaining about 10 seconds, but it can be tedious, that's all. If I'm not going very far, I just don't use it.-The same power button is the same button to call the last person you spoke to. So if you press it for x amount of seconds, trying to turn it off, you could be making a call and not know it. Annoying!-The earbud doesn't fit my ears well. My ears are pretty average, I think. I dont think it's the earbud's fault though. It comes with an attachment that hooks around the ear, but for me, it doesn't fit.-To use the speakerphone part, you have to turn on both, the earbud and the speaker. To use the earbud, you don't really have to put on the speaker part. That's neither here nor there.All in all it's not bad, just has some quirks in my mind. Would I recommend it...mmm, yes, but with a disclaimer.
B0024FA6QW	It basically works - But nothing special.People have trouble hearing me - So I have to speak loudly - Even shout to be heard.I've been looking in vain for a plain, wired headset with a standard boom mike -They only make Bluetooth devices for these new phones.Very Frustrating!JC
B0024FA6QW	I just bought this device. The major con is that if you have the ear hook attached, you CAN NOT put it in the cradle! I'll take my dremel to it eventually and see if I can fix that issue, but as an engineer I have to wonder WTF happened there? Didn't they test it? Pretty stupid to have a 2 cent part stump the entire system from working.Once I put this in the car, the hands free part will be in always on mode. Same for the ear bud. If it goes dead, well I'm going to wire it directly into the car's power so I don't see that as an issue really. I bought this more as a hands free phone, having the option of an earbud with it just seemed like a nice extra feature.
B0024FA6QW	I been using this for almost a year now. its pain in the ass to charge it all the time but works great. the only downside is that when you drive on the hwy and try to use the speaker phone, you do have to speak very loud for the other end to hear you. unless if you have great car that dont make too much noise when you drive on the hwy.
B0024FA6QW	Edited after one week!I have been using this product for about a week. The ear piece is not comfortable, nor does it have good sound quality. As a matter of fact I can not hear the conversation because the volume is so very low. I really can not recommend it and will return it asap.I received the LG HBM-800 Bluetooth Mono Headset with Speakerphone and Charging Cradle this afternoon. It paired and connected almost instantly. I have a couple of concerns after using it for only a few hours. First is that the earpiece is not very comfortable. It wasn't that it really hurt or made my ear feel raw but, it did bother me enough that I caught myself adjusting it time and time again. I will try it for a few days but may try to return it. Second is the clip on the ear piece. With the clip attached it will not slide into the visor hands free unit. You must first pull the clip off. Since it is plastic as well as the part it slides onto, i wonder how long it will last if I try to remove and replace it frequently. If either part breaks it will be garbage. Third is the visor clip. It is very flimsy plastic and attaches to the back of the unit by 1/4 turn lock. Again if this breaks it will make the unit much less convenient to use.These concerns aside, the sound quality is great. The people that I have spoken with did not realize that I was on a headset or a speaker phone, even with the drivers side window in my truck halfway down. The blue-tooth strength is more than adequate and allows me to leave my phone on my dresser with my keys and walk anywhere in the house, even the backyard while I am grilling. This is the first headset that has allowed me to use the voice command feature on my phone, (Samsung Captivate), with the headset. I have tried three other headsets and the blue-tooth in my other car but the voice command feature did not work. I found this very impressive.I read several reviews before purchasing this. I understood some of the possible flaws and decided to chance it anyway. I found the design faults that others had reported to be not so much of a problem and even a plus in some cases. The turn on/off issue reported by several reviews makes perfect sense to me. If you were to leave it on all of the time you would constantly have a dead battery. Most vehicles have a utility plug that the power shuts off on when the vehicle is turned off, so even if you were to leave it plugged in all of the time you would have the same problem. I use the ear piece all of the time and place it in the desktop charger overnight and don't bother turning it off at all. So yes I do have to turn the speakerphone on/off every time I get in or out of the car but I don't mind the second or two it takes to do it.The package contains everything needed to use both devices together or separately. A desktop charger for the earpiece, power cord for the speakerphone, and car charger that fits both. For the price I feel that it is a great product. Now if it will just last me a year it will have been totally worth the small expense.
B0024FA6QW	The plastic visor clip isn't very durable and one must be careful in using it.  That said, the headset works very well and the speaker phone function is more than adequate in a pinch.
B0024FA6QW	I love this item so much I bought 1 for each of my cars. I have also recommended it to all of my friends.
B0024FA6QW	I purchased this after trying the Sony-Ericsson HBC-150 bluetooth speakerphone and this product is way better while using my LG Dare.  I initially bought the HBC-150 for its capability to display caller IDs to screen incoming calls.  I found it was not a good product for my phone (see my review of the HBC-150).  After that ordeal, I thought of settling for one that just worked for my phone.  What I got from the LG HBM-800 was much better than that.To me, it seems like a simple product.  A speakerphone that doubles as a headset.  It's like, "Why couldn't somebody think of this sooner?"  Someone probably did but not in a package like this one:- The speakerphone is clear and loud enough.- People on the other side of the conversation had no problems hearing me.  Note: I can't speak in to it when it's right in front of me.  The mic is on the left side so you would need to talk to it when fastened to the right side of the car visor.- My phone has GPS and I was able to use the speakerphone to get audible directions without a hitch.- If I go out of range and come back I get reconnected with a push of a button, except when the headset automatically turns off after some time.  The cradle doesn't turn off automatically.The only trouble I have with the LG HBM-800 is the low battery warning on the cradle.  The problem is that it's not a warning, it simply doesn't work as a speakerphone anymore.  You'll just have to use the headset until you recharge the cradle.  I guess it's better than leaving you without an option.  I just wished the cradle had a better battery life.Overall it's a great product and it's simple enough that you don't need to fuss with.
B0024FA6QW	This is a great idea! A speaker phone and an ear piece in one device. I love the idea of a speakerphone that allows you to pick up an ear piece to have a private conversation without breaking the law when driving. I want LG and other manufacturers to improve on this product. The feedback on this devices having too few buttons, resulting in me dialing someone when I intended to turn off the device is true. I have to turn on the device/pairing again after you get back in the car is again true. What stopped me from using this device is the plastic hook/clip that attaches the device to the visor broke. My fault, but if it was made of metal like my current SuperTooth Buddy Bluetooth Visor Speakerphone Car kit, it could have avoided a pre-mature retirement.
B0029WFAD4	I've had this headset for a year.  Have a similar form factor older "Calisto Pro" with a phone/home base as well.Besides excellent all day fit, good noise cancellation in all but heavy wind, the versatility of this unit is unique.The bluetooth to usb dongle upgrades the bluetooth "class" that gives a 300ft distance, and allows one to not even need a phone if one has a laptop connected to the network.  I don't use this feature often, but it is very nice to havePairing to any of my devices (home DECT phones, car, Android phone, USB dongle) are all simple after the first time.It has a USB to device charging cable so I don't need to take the charging stand with me; seems to charge just as fast as the stand when plugged into the laptop usb port.I don't use a hearing aid, but with too much/too loud rock and roll through the years, using this unit, even if phones are available is the norm for me.  Allows use of both hands, and is a godsend in open landscape environments, allowing me to hear better against the background noise, and not transmitting much of that noise to the other end.I can't recommend this unit enough.  It may go by another name model now, not sure, but look for the form factor and the USB -- bluetooth dongle (not dect, that's a different model - the DECT units are great, but don't pair to bluetooth so won't work with your mobile device).ADS
B0029WFAD4	This works with Microsoft communicator, but ALSO works with skype. There is another similar product that only works with communicator. Call the company for details. Amazon has new stock.Best thing I ever bought for a home office and video teaching/discussions.
B0029WFAD4	I bought this headset for using with both my PC (VOIP/Skype) and cell phone. I looked at several similar units and chose this one based on my experiences with analog Plantronics headsets.The boom mic with the ear loop and ear piece are all comfortable to wear for several hours at a time. I like that I can flip the hook over and use it on either ear. Sound quality is good, even in noisy situations. At first the dongle did not work with my tower PC, but I realized my front panel USB jacks are USB 3.0. When I brought an extension around from the back and plugged it into a USB 2.0 port, the dongle worked fine. When using the headset with my tower PC, dongle, and Plantronics software, I see charging level displayed in the system tray. On my laptop with a Bluetooth radio, no extra software is necessary.One complaint with the unit are it has a proprietary charging connector. While my unit came with a charging dock, there is also a USB cable for charging on the road. Why isn't this connector a standard USB-B micro like most (non-iPhone) cell phones and headsets today? I don't need another one-off cable in my bag. Battery life is decent, but not great. I can't go all week on a charge, even in standby mode, so the charging cable is a must.Like most Bluetooth headsets, Plantronics chose to assign multiple functions to the same button, depending on how long you hold it or how many times you press it. I'm not a fan of this as it's confusing if I should press once, twice, or hold for 5 seconds. I would prefer to have several buttons with dedicated functions.Pairing to my Samsung Galaxy Nexus is hit-or-miss. Some times when I turn both on, they are paired. Other times they are not. Instead of just allowing me to re-pair, I usually have to un-pair first, then re-pair. I think this is more a problem with the Bluetooth stack in Android Jellybean.Overall, a good headset, but it has a few annoyances that detract.
B0029WFAD4	The product works great on my PC laptop, but does not work with my Mac. I wanted to use it primarily for my Mac Book Air, but unfortunately am only able to use it with my PC. If you only have a PC and want to use this, I do recommend it. The earpiece adaptor took a little while to get used to, but once I manhandled it, it conformed to my ear
B0029WFAD4	I have been using BT headsets for my phone and desktop(Lync/OCS) for a while but the biggest pain I had with previous headsets was batter life and distance I could be away from my machine. This headset changed everything, I can roam freely around without disconnecting from my calls. I can also use the headset for listening to music (not great but works). I find the battery life on this headset to be awesome it seems to last forever (I do put it on the docking station every night).I totally recommend this headset for anyone that needs to use the headset for long durations.
B0029WFAD4	Used it for a while, but decided to send it back and get the plantronics voyager ledgend since its more geared to people who use their bluetooth w your cell phone.. This does work great for cellphones, but if your like me and use your bluetooth all day, then this is a little bulky... this would be best for someone who uses a cellphone and internet phone line, or someone who uses a computer speech-to-text program a lot..
B0029WFAD4	Worked great for other applications but when used with Dragon Naturally speaking Medical Edition, it didn't work as well as expected. I know I have to retrain but when in the process of retraining I was frustrated. Other than that program it works well. Skype and others worked well. I ended up returning and purchased a different one from Logitech, which is not a Bluetooth but straight wireless with dongle.
B0029WFAD4	I use this product daily with my cell phone, Skype and Microsoft Lync.The sound quality on both ends is amazing.My only (very minor) complaint is around battery life - it's a bit short if you are working with others on a con-call all day but, because you can charge from USB, you can easily top up at any time without going offline.I too like the fact that because you can charge from USB, you can easily take it on the road without the base.Highly recommend!
B0029WFAD4	This is an excellent product.  I use it for Skype and you don't feel you are tied to the computer or chair.  It is excellent with incredible reception.  I would recommend this to anyone!
B0029WFAD4	A friend is hard of hearing and I would have to repeat and talk louder. Good if you want to talk quieter because the mic is closer to your mouth.
B0029WFAD4	I found that this bluetooth was much larger than I had expected.  It didn't fit in my ear very well. I lost the soft ear adapter and could not find a replacement.  I would not recommend this item to anyone that was at least 8' tall.
B0041IH852	My wife got this for me for Christmas.  I was a skeptic when it came to any type of headset for my cell phone, but now I never take it out of my ear.  My wife tells me that it wasn't as expensive as she thought and now I want to get her one.  This particular model is the HK200, but it doesn't say it anywhere on the listing.  It's a great headset as far as I can tell.  I've been using it every day ever since I got pulled over for talking using my speaker phone in my hand.
B0041IH852	People I am talking to complain that they hear a lot of background noise. I used the newer version of this headset before and never heard any complaints.
B0041IH852	This is the only headset that I found that will work with the Motorola Mototrbo digital radio Bluetooth adapter.  The more advanced headsets are not compatible with the simple system the radio uses.
B0041IH852	I've been using this headset for a few months now, and haven't had any problems.  It fits comfortably, and my ear never gets sore.  I also paired it with my laptop, and that worked fine as well.  The only negative thing I have is the mute function didn't work with my HTC Aria phone.  Everything else worked, but for some reason it won't mute with the headset.All in all, I would recommend the headset.
B0041IH852	Sounds like Diva King got her a knock off (Generic) headset and was ripped off. Not too smart from a buying standpoint! I just bought mine and it paired immediately after I fully charged it and then made a call and the reception was superb and just the quality I would expect from a Motorola product. While some may pay 14.99 and think they're getting a great deal, buyers beware of cheap imitations for cheap prices! Good Luck!
B0041IH852	No &#34;sound cancellation&#34;, at least not anything that is effective anyway. I can't use it in the car because outside/road noise is too much on the other end (I don't hear it). Otherwise it's a bluetooth headset, so what more to say.
B0041IH852	When I received the Bluetooth first of all the packaging was terrible, meaning the box was torn and beat up pretty bad... The description of the product said the bluetooth was new, well I can't tell.  I can't hear anything when linked to my phone.  I charged it all day and it still didn't work.  I can't hear my recipient but they can hear me.  I want a refund ASAP.Please contact me ASAP.Thank youLatonya King
B0041IH852	MOTO really came thru. We used this and used it. We have only Kudos for this products. Thank You Moto and Amazon
