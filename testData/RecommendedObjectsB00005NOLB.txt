B004ES74WQ	Great product !! Fast shippIng!!!!Eactly what I needed . Very sturdy and precise. It's used for Samsung galaxy tablet and all other tablets.
B004ES74WQ	This was the missing part for my iPad. A little expensive for what it is but it is good quality.I wish it came with my iPad already.The nice thing about it is that it avoids finger marks and is very pleasant to use.I highly recommend it!!
B004ES74WQ	Exactly what I needed - a stylus for my iPad and a pen for instances where I am handed and actual piece of paper! The stylus moves smoothly unlike what I heard about other similar products. The pen - well, it writes like a pen should. Simple enough.
B004ES74WQ	I bought this pen to use with my iPad2.  I was specifically looking for something more compact at the time that was a dual pen/stylus.  This fit the bill and performs well.  I've never had any problems with it.  The pen isn't great but I don't use it very often.  The stylus part is good--while it is still basically writing with a crayon, it isn't a huge mushy crayon like some others.  It has a good solid feel and reasonable weight.2 reasons for losing a star:  mostly 1) when using it as a pen the cap doesn't attach over the stylus, and less-so 2) it'd be nice if the body were steel so that it'd stick to the magnets in my Apple cover.
B004ES74WQ	Acase Capacitive Stylus Pen Combo for Apple iPad, Samsung Galaxy, Blackberry Playbook (Jet Black)Nice and easy to use as a stylus but worthless as a pen. Either doesn't write or ink comes out sporadically.
B004ES74WQ	Because my fingers don't work as easily as they did years ago I have problems using the keyboard on the Kindle Fire, so I thought I would see if this pen would do the job.  It isn't advertised as working with the Kindle Fire, but it does the job quite nicely.
B004ES74WQ	I alway need a pen while working and the stylus make txting and note taking very easy.  I use this on a IPad and Iphone. The length is alittle longer then other stylus, make this easier to hold. After the orginial purchase i had to order a backup.You will love it.
B004ES74WQ	I did a search on stylus pens and I knew this one for me, it works very well on my Motorola Zoom, and it has an ink pen on the other end, it also match the color of my xoom.  Great Buy
B004ES74WQ	I bought the Acase 2 in 1 stylus which I found very practical because it's a pen and stylus in one and the stylus does not require undue pressure when writing on the iPad so it feels much natural.  The pen is ok, as I don't use it that much but when I try to use it it takes a few strokes to get the ink running. Nonetheless I beleive as a stylus it's the best.
B004ES74WQ	I love this pen since it makes it easier to scroll and click on items. Unfortunately it is not childproof. I just ordered another as my grandson pulled the tip off. Can this be fixed. The tip disappeared so I could not try.
B004ES74WQ	I really like this one.  It's heavy in the hand like a quality pen and the stylus works really well. I only wish there was a way to attach it to my iPad. I would buy this one again.
B004ES74WQ	Great little stylus and it writes.  Perfect for meetings!  My only complaint is that I wish the stylus was as long as a traditional pen.
B004ES74WQ	I have been using it for a while. It has its issues, the worse being the imprecision on some games and being not responsive right when you need it, but other than that it is ok product.
B004ES74WQ	This is a great stylus for inking apps such as penultimate or note shelf.  It's convenient to have a pen as well.  However, so far I find it a little difficult to get the clip over the fabric of my shirt pocket, so I'm giving only four stars, instead of the five I give to the stylus only AcaseAcase Apple iPad Capacitive Stylus (Crimson Red), which has a great clip and the same writing stylus tip.
B004ES74WQ	One of the better stylus on the market that works well on the iPads... also works as a real pen too!
B004ES74WQ	Stylus works just fine. The tip seems a little soft for my tastes but works nonetheless. One thing I don't like is the fact that there's no where to store the pen cap when you take it off to use the pen. Usually on a ballpoint pen you put it on the other end, but because of the stylus you can't do that so you have a cap to keep track of now.
B004ES74WQ	The pen writes nice and the stylus part does the job. I just wish the clip didn't fall off so easyly. The clip broke on mine about two days after I started using it. For the price, I wish the quality was better.
B004ES74WQ	I keep buying them and i keep losing them or i keep buying them and they dont work or i keep buying them and the tips fall off.  Sure nothing can replace a keyboard but between this stylus and those new gloves made for ipads and iphones i can once again venture out in the cold and still write a thought or call a friend. It would be nice though if it came in colors and a had a lanyard for my neck or better yet, if someone made a case for the phone or pad that held the stylus/pen.Even my hip daughter wanted one.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ES74WQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B004ES74WQ	This has the same shortfall as every other IPAD stylus in that it has a soft rubber end and can not write small letters.  The pen portion is nothing special but it works.  assuming you don't need to write  small or draw in great detail this will work fine.
B004ES74WQ	I ordered this to use  for my iPad. It is perfect to slide onto the inner iPad case between uses. It works fine for tapping the small boxes or links , so I don't have to increase the size of the screen document first in order to use it, which is not the case when using the larger stylus. Overall, the smaller stylus is a good buy.
B004ES74WQ	I bought this stylus pen for my iPAD a while ago. it works very well and has improved iPad functionality for me a lot. Only bad part is that clip for the pen cover came loose very soon and it is an inconvenience to carry the pen without the clip. I wish that the clip was sturdier but stylus itself functions just fine. It write exactly where it touches on the iPad and flows smoothly over the surface.  I also use the ballpoint pen which is part of the stylus pen and thus I don't have to carry a separate pen to write on paper or sign some documents.
B007J6NUE6	This is my first time using a stylus so there's no comparison really but I have grown used to the idea and also use it with my iPhone...it's actually a perfect accessory for me because I grow my fingernails long and have been using my knuckles since I can't use my finger tips. I have since bought another pair...it goes hand-in-hand with my Nook and my iPhone. Great price! A steal!!
B007J6NUE6	I absolutely love these & I have been able to use them for my nook & at work. I was highly satisfied.
B007J6NUE6	This product when trying to use it on Nook to click on an item it will select the item three down instead if the screen actually recognizes something moving on the screen
B007J6NUE6	Awesome. This will encourage my 5 yr old to use a pencil/pen rather than a touch screen all the time. Packaging great and received within timeframe of expected delivery.  Thank you!
B007J6NUE6	For the most part works great with my nook - certain paging functions still only with with the flip of the finger.  I like especially like it for typing.  It also works well on my smart phone!
B007J6NUE6	These stylus' are awesome. They work perfect on my NOOK tablet. The color of them is as show in the pictures. Very happy with them.
B007J6NUE6	Very nice product. Is gentle on my nook screen and does not leave any marks behind.  Plus, the color is a pretty pink!
B007J6NUE6	be nice if there were somewhere inside to attach. shared w/ daughter she like it product is great for price.
B007J6NUE6	good price, exactly what my wife wanted.  Like all styli, it is short, but not too short to use.  Color(pink) is as advertised and not too shockingly bright.
