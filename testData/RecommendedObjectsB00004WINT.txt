B000NJGDUY	Great product; does the job.  Inexpensive.  Great shipping.  Would order from this vendor again.
B000NJGDUY	Charger connection to bluetooth is poor.  It does not connect well and sometimes looses connection which causes poor charge performance.
B000NJGDUY	This product works perfectly on my plantronics 320 bluetooth handsfree headset. The price is good and it arrived on time.
B000NJGDUY	Hey,This product has excellent voice quality, but battery life....simply sucksssssssssssss.......so be carefull while buying,...I goona buy new one too./..
B000NJGDUY	This charger is great for times when you don't have access to your computer. I would highly recommend it for those who travel frequently.
B000NJGDUY	Unfortunately I have to buy a new bluetooth headset every couple of months or so because I lose them all the time.  This one was no different because I lost it too, a few weeks ago, and replaced it with the Samsung WEP475 Bluetooth Headset which I like much better.  Quite honestly, I've had a few Plantronics headsets in my time and I never really cared for any of them.
B000NJGDUY	No problems.  Very happy with the product so far.  I am also very happy with the price.
B000NJGDUY	Product works great thus far. I've only had it and used it for a few weeks but I've not had any issues.
B000NJGDUY	Received order in a timely fashion, pleased with the product andhow easily we could obtain it.
B000NJGDUY	Item was thrown in the box without any packaging arrived scuffed up and looking used.
B000NJGDUY	I have never purchased this product before. I think that it would be well worth your paying a little more for a better ear-bud. Only had for a few weeks and it stopped working. Also while it was on it blocked outgoing calls. If the bud was on after I made call,it dropped the call. The company is sending me another one,But next time I will spend a little more and get something different.
B000NJGDUY	I bought this item for a bluetooth device given to me. The charger worked great- charged the device as it should. However, the bluetooth device was defective (the reason for the giveaway, no doubt!).
B000NJGDUY	No problem watsoever. Works fine. I had bought this as my BT device was shipped to me with wrong charger. I have no problem with this product.
B000NJGDUY	I left my original charger in a hotel when I made a recent trip.  This replacement was just what I needed.  It arrived quickly, was packed superbly, and works perfectly!
B000NJGDUY	This adapter works just as great as the original adapter received when phone was purchased.
B000NJGDUY	This is exact same as the one that came with my original bluetooth.  Does its job.
B001CTEUXQ	Very disappointed with the product. I had been using a Jawbone, but lost it. I decided to try something else since the Jawbone was the most expensive option where I was shopping (BestBuy iirc) and I liked the necklace-strap that comes with it, which I thought would be useful and reduce the chances of my misplacing this one as I had done with the Jawbone. Big miskake - the sound quality is very poor (lots of complaints from callers who never complained when I was using the Jawbone) - it's especially bad if you are outside and there is any wind, a condition under which the Jawbone performed well. I've also had two of the three earbuds that came with the headset just fall off over the course of the day, leaving me one ill-fitting set away from needing to acquire replacements. Further, the strap is about an inch too short to reach comfortably to my ear when around my neck. When the last earbud inevitably falls off, I'll go back to a Jawbone or try another option after asking around.
B001CTEUXQ	Nokia's BH-703 is the best headset I have owned yet. I go through many of these whether due to loss or just looking for something better. Prior to this one, I spent nearly three months with three different Jawbone Primes. Why three months and three different Primes? Because they were defective in one way or another. The first simply didn't give the quality or battery life claimed, which are two areas you would expect if paying a premium price. The second simply stopped working after a few weeks and the third was the same as the first. In contrast, this unit has excellent sound in all conditions including those that Jawbone exclaim (noise cancellation and wind). It's light and barely noticeable (I forget it's on sometimes and my wife will ask me late at night how long I plan to keep it on). The controls are well placed and, in keeping a Jawbone comparison, much easier to use and don't stick (Jawbone's Noise Assassin button kept "stickking" on all three I had). The battery life is most likely the best I can remember of all my sets. Talk time is at least the claimed 6-hours. I talk a lot on these things everyday - the BH-703 will last 2-3 days with heavy use and leaving on 24/7. Lighter use, I've had it go over a week. Jawbone? Good luck getting a day out of it - this was the same on all three so poor battery life must actually be a "feature."Finally, Nokia always makes good, reliable products and has excellent warranty support (I haven't had to use warranty for this, but have owned many Nokia devices over the years).
B001CTEUXQ	I bought the bluetooth for my boyfriend a year ago.He still uses it and he loves it!Works just fine!
B001CTEUXQ	Not only is the design very futuristic but the build quality is superb. Ofcourse the syncing, battery life, call quality are all well above average. Its difficult to see how small and discreet this really is. My only request is for Nokia to add the blue LED on the side where it is visible. The finger swipe volume control is innovative and extremely practical.
B001CTEUXQ	Even though it is really small it has great sound and it has a lot of secrets that make it a very good option although I think it is a little expensive but fancy anyway.
B002B8BUUI	I have a pair of Motorola bluetooth headphones that I use with my 4th gen iPod Nano and that combination is just OK; I suffer lots of dropouts if the units don't have a clear line of sight, so I'm forced to have the iPod in an armband high up on my arm.  This adaptor doesn't work with my 5th gen Nano at all; it doesn't turn off the built in speaker nor does it connect with my headphones.  I have seen reviews for the Scosche TuneStream unit, but that doesn't work for 5th gen iPods either.
B002B8BUUI	It works!but I dropped it like 2 feet from the ground and it cracked and now it's unusable.WTF? Durability is horrifyingly terrible.
B002B8BUUI	I have hearing aids that are blu tooth compatable.  This products works well with IPOD.  A "streamer" is required.
B002B8BUUI	I Purchase this item due to the lack of Bluetooth in my I pod .It's incredible easy to operate and it works great!!The quality of sound that delivers is fantastic, with no interference or distortion.Highly recomended!!!
B002B8BUUI	It works great and made my life a lot better now I can talk through my blackberry and hear my Ipod while driving without getting distracted!...
B002B8BUUI	Signal strength is limited and can be blocked by your body if you carry your iPod in your pocket.  Less battery drain than I expected.  Sound quality is OK.
B002B8BUUI	The d650 bluetooth adapter is a nifty device it enables the connection of my Motorola s9 HD wireless headset to my second gen Nano. The size is not bad since it is the same width and depth as my ipod, it is a little cumbersome but managable. It does have some interferance by heavy clothing if stuck in a pocket, but that issue is solved with placing it in a closer region relative to the headset. It does zap quite a bit of power from the ipod itself, so be ready to charge the ipod more often. I got a great price on my D650 here, so it was really worth the money.Ebay consumer
