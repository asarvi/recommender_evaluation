B001MSRC2I	It's nice to have an extra charger to leave at work because that is where you spend most of your time outside of the home, and I don't have to keep bringing it back and forth.  Great price and value.
B001MSRC2I	Just the same as the one that comes with the phone. Great replacement, or just to have an extra. We got ours as a replacement because my son lost his original. Quick shipping and works. Some replacement chargers do not charge as quickly. This still charges just as quick as the original.
B001MSRC2I	It charges my phone and I haven't had any issues with it, except for one small issue and that is that it doesn't lock into your phone when it charges and so sometimes the charger slips out of the phone.  I usually set the phone down to charge though so I don't have much of a problem with that.  So all together it does what it should do with little issue.
B001MSRC2I	lost the other charger and here was a non-oem though I would give it a try. It works as advertised
B001MSRC2I	This is the one for you. The price doesn't get better. It does the job.
B001MSRC2I	the charger fit and worked great! the only thing i would have liked was the cord to be a little bit longer but this didnt take away from the overall quality of the product!
B001MSRC2I	Shipping and everything was great. However, the charger broke quickly. Perhaps the quality isn't so great. But this charger is a great temporary one.
B001MSRC2I	Needed it for a temporary replacement phone for my nephew. Works good. Awesome price, too. Definitely better than getting it from a retail store.
B001MSRC2I	This charger works great and so is the price. There is also a really bright blue light that stays on while it's charging, which is kind of fun. I would recommend this to anyone looking for this charger. I bought it because I needed to use a back up phone while my current phone screen was getting fixed. I didn't have the charger to my back up, so I purchased this charger. It does what it needs to do.
B001MSRC2I	i have owned this all of 2 months and it fell apart...really FELL APART. made of flimsy plastic. the connection pulled off and the plug just cracked in half with no harsh treatment.
B003L9PDBS	Best charger I've ever owned - bought in conjunction with a superior USB cord (another vendor, also on Amazon) and this thing charges FAST.  Only downside is the bright glowing light on the front.  It's TOO bright and distracting for a bedside charger
B003L9PDBS	Great product at an excellent price. You will not be disappointed. I will be buying more for around the house and office.
B003L9PDBS	Is the best usb charger for a phone.  Just need the cord adapter for my HTC Incredible.  It charges the phone quickly.  Is better than the cheap chargers for phone.
B003L9PDBS	It works but takes longer to charge the battery than the standard charger. This is because the actual power requirement for charging the HTC Incredible (by Verizon) is "5 Volts DC at 1 Amp" (as written on the phone label under the battery). However, this charger only puts out "5 Volts DC at 700mA" (its 300 milliamps short). This results in a slower charge.Please let me know if this review has helped you.
B003L9PDBS	IT IS GREAT EVERYTHING WENT FIND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND PRICE TO ANYONE.FOR THE PRICE ALONE IS A GREAT DEAL BUT THE PRODUCT IS GREAT
B006LXD31I	This tri-connect device did not work for me. Why I'm not sure exactly, but out of the 3 different ports neither of them actually allowed me to connect my MacBook Air. The good thing was that Amazon allowed me to return it and get a refund!
B006LXD31I	DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort....plenty of options for connecting to your monitor of choice.  Bought 2 (1 for office/1 for home)....allows me to connect to extra monitor effortlessly.
B006LXD31I	I've been using this consistently for several months now. I travel extensively and replaced two separate HDMI and DVI adapters with this one.I was a bit skeptical given the low price, especially compared to the official Apple adapters, but it works flawlessly. I had to remind myself that digital signals are either on or off - so it either works or it doesn't.Just purchased another one of these for another team member today.
B006LXD31I	I like this adapter.  It looks and feels like an apple product, and it works like a charm.  I've only had it for a couple weeks, so I'll follow up if anything happens to it.
B006LXD31I	I was unhappy about the product, that it was not connecting with my Toshiba tv and that there were no instructions how to fix it.
B006LXD31I	This is a great product for those that travel or work in offices that have various different display connection type.  Just  as identified and shipped very quickly.
B006LXD31I	What a value! This handy adaptor (for the price of a single DVI, HDMI or Displayport adaptor) gives you 3 possibilities in one.The only thing it doesn't work with is VGA... which is becoming increasingly rare anyway.Great for travel, office use (what kind of projector is it? who cares!), and even home use if you want to hook up your Mac to a TV.
