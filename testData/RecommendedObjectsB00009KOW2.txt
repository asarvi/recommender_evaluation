B000AQCBU6	Very easy to setup with a RAZR V3. The sound volume was loud enough  when at max. The callers complained of wind noise and it sounds flat. Voice dailing through the headset worked almost as well as the handset.I would not buy this handset because of the "flatness"
B000AQCBU6	Since purchasing my Razr, I've done some extensive shopping and comparison to improve upon my Motorola H820 Bluetooth headset.  After trying a couple other popular brands, I've returned to this model and am very happy with it.For Razr users, the H500 uses the same charging attachment as the Razr, which is HUGE plus.  The button placement is simple, and easy to master.  I had no problems whatsoever getting the headset to connect with my phone, or using it to place calls.Sometimes less is more -- that's certainly the case with this little Bluetooth headset.  It's the best all-around value in a Bluetooth headset, especially for use with a Razr.
B000AQCBU6	I went to Bluetooth about three years ago and this model was the unit I chose (luckily).  I can't STAND to hold a cellphone to my head anymore !  That first one held up to over two years of 4000 to 5000 minutes per month with no problems whatsoever.  I would still have that first unit except my parents' pugs got it off the table and gnawed it up pretty good.I ordered this new one identical in every way and again am working it day after day with excellent results.  Some of my co-workers have other brands (like Jawbone) that drop in and out quite frequently.  The sound quality is not as good as my Motorola, either.  Mine stays on my ear comfortable all the time except when I sleep.  As you can tell... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!
B000AQCBU6	This device works OK with my KRZR but you get what you pay for. Sometimes the sound is "crackly" and broken up. I need to have the volume all the way up most of the time.The volume buttons are also hard to find when I'm using it. It's hard to tell if I'm pushing the buttons or not. Since the headset fits so loosely I have to hold the device with my thumb while pushing the up volume button. The problem is that my thumb ends up pressing the down volume button at the same time. This causes the device to mute unintentionally.Same problem with the other button. It's used for all of the other functions. Since I can't really tell if I have pushed it I don't know if I have ended a call or just put it on hold. I always have to open the phone to check and make sure.It seems to add a lot of latency to the conversation, but that my be true with any BT headset.It fits loosely on my ear. If I turn my head fast enough if flies off. I don't mean whiplash fast either.I doubt that I would purchase another one of these.
B000AQCBU6	Works great, fits well and is easy to set up and use. I'm not sure if others have this feature but I'd sure like it if you could tell how much charge was left in the battery. I hate going out with it just to have it die in the middle of a call. Battery life is not bad but I just cannot tell how much charge is left so I end up constantly charging it.
B000AQCBU6	One of the best Bluetooth headsets out there considering quality, price, and design.
B000AQCBU6	This is my first bluetooth headset. So far no problems whatsoever. The unit came box-less so I'm unsure if its refurbished, but everything looks new. Hooking this unit up to my Motorola Rokr E6 was easy, but I bought this unit mainly for my PS3 and so far have worked flawlessly on both.Gotta love the shipping from CCMA accessories. Ordered it on Saturday and received it on Tuesday shipped from NY to SF.Love the unit and love the price.
B000AQCBU6	Sound quality is OK, volume could go higher but overall it is bearable. However, the microphone buzzes all the time. I tried this headset with two different USB dongles and different drivers but nothing helped. Search on internet revealed that some people also had this problem even with some phones.Save yourself trouble: do not buy this headset.
B000AQCBU6	I rec`d it rather quickly. The packaging did not make me feel it was a new unit but instead a refurb. It does work well, at least everyone I talk to can hear me clearly & I hear them clearly. There are a few times a little distortion sets in however, I`m told that`s common w/ these headsets.
B001DSETPK	I really like this headset. I recently got a new phone decided that I needed a new headset to go with it. I wanted a headset that plays music.This headset does a pretty good job of playing music. It will control the music on most newer phones. I really like the disconnectable ear-piece. They will play music with one ear or two(The only variable is how much you like to party). This wasn't stated clearly anywhere I read about this set. I bought this instead of the Moto Rocker set.The call quality is good too. It's light and comfortable. I'm amazed with the call time, although this is the first L-ion rechargable headset that I've owned.This is a good set for the price. In fact even if I had piles of money I would probably just tell you to buy this one.
B001DSETPK	Sound quality: goodComfort: horribleThis device works ok in terms of audio but the discomfort of the horribly designed earbuds and loop screams at you. None of the 3 different earbuds fit properly and the ear loop, which is supposed to help secure the piece, is very flimsy. This headset should not have made it to the market.
B001DSETPK	It is very old model.So you can not buy accessary like stereo cable anymore.Sound quality is not bad. But different sound output left between right.
B001DSETPK	"....By  Ronald J. Rio "rjr" (Colorado) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)I'm really impressed with the flexibility of this headset. You can use it with the boom or without, with the ear-clips or without, 4 different sets of buds, you get the picture. I replaced my old Motorolla H500. This was different for me with the buds, which definitely improves the sound quality. The link to my BB8830 was flawless. I really, really, love the stereo adapter - for music AND for phone calls. When in stereo, all outside noise is shutout which is great for listening to business calls. I have not had cordless stereo headsets before, but used these on a 5 hour flight and the battery held all the way, music quality was good. Not as dynamic as wired buds, but no interuption, static, etc. Very impressive for the low price.""Ronald hit is on the head.  I also love them. I use it at work to listen to the music on my LG Dare phone, and only use the mono earpiece, I don't use the stereo one, but it work great with or without.  answering calls is the best too.  you can slide the boom, or press the answer button, talk and then hang up and it goes right back to the song that you were listening too.It's terrific. A must have.  If I could give it a 8 out of a 10 I would.
B001DSETPK	Works well.  I have used it to listen to stereo music from my smart phone, and could easily hold conversations at highway speeds while traveling with the top down in my convertible. I now own two of these units.
B001DSETPK	I have had several other Plantronics and some Motorola bluetooths and they have all had their shortcomings, but this one ranks the best. The stereo quality is impressive and the battery life is really good. My only complaint is my ear type isn't really accepting to the buds which slip out often. The biggest fear I have is that it is slipping one time when my hands aren't free and hits the ground. I love my bluetooth, I just don't know how long it'll last unless there are other buds that I'm just not aware of. Overall, great device but not made for ALL ear sizes (mine are too small).

Not as dynamic as wired buds, but no interuption, static, etc.  Very impressive for the low price.
B001DSETPK	Doesn't work with HTC Dream / Android 1.5. It is most likely to be a problem with Android, not the headset. The headset is not comfortable and will not stay in place.
B001DSETPK	So far I like this unit. It was easy to link to my Verizon Env2 phone (LG9100). If I have a complaint it is that the smallest ear bud still seems a bit tight in my ear canals, and they do cause my ears to sweat somewhat more than normal. While the sound could always be better, it is just fine to me and is what I had expected or hoped for. It is really nice to be working at your desk and be able to listen to music without the hassles of a cord tying you to the phone or the computer.
B001DSETPK	I have used MANY different bluetooth headsets.  This one was my first stereo headset, however.  Overall, this headset is amazing.  The stereo quality is quite remarkable.  Other than bass response, they are nearly as good as my Sony wired headsets, but they are WIRELESS!  I can't tell you how amazing it is to just have it lightly wrapped behind your neck.  It's a delight.  And if you just need mono, just pop off the little cable and you're good-to-go.  And the audio is still crystal clear from the single mono headset.  I am using this with the iPhone 3Gs, and all of the features work except track skip (still seeing if it's something I'm doing wrong).  When a call comes in, just slide the little boom out toward your mouth and voila, music stops and it answers the call.  Done with the call, slide it back in and the music starts right back up!  Need to pause the music, just push a little button on the top, and it pauses.  Start back up?  Just push the little button again!  Voice dial?  But of course!  Just hold the call button down about 2 seconds and your prompted with the iPhone's voice control!  Absolutely a delight to use.  LONG battery life.  I have been listening to it for HOURS on end at a pretty high volume, made quite a few calls, and it's still going strong.  I have NO complaints about the unit.  Feels great in my ears.  Very light, very comfortable.  And it's even a steal of a deal now that it's dropped so much in price.  If you're in the market for a GREAT bluetooth headset, this one should most certainly be on your short list.
B001DSETPK	it is a nice headset no longer time to battery charge but i can use it for two weeks(for normal use), and also low-priced for good specifications.
B002JMALHE	Works really well with my iPhone and in the car with the windows down. Lasts a lot longer than I expected. So comfortable that I forget I'm wearing it.
B002JMALHE	This is an older model but it works fine.  I have been using it every day since I got it.  Can't live without it now.
B002JMALHE	First, I have owned the Z9 and Z9i and found the audio to be amazingly good under noisy conditions including driving with the drivers window open at highway speed with some noise but readable reported by the other party.The rubber cushioned earpiece is comfortable but delicate and I have torn both of the included parts within two months usage.  This seems to happen when I use the built in clip to keep it on my shirt collar or pocket.  When I called Blueant and explained it was a new unit and under warranty, I was told I would have to purchase a replacement.  Not cool! especially since I cannot use the metal ear clip as it isn't long enough to stay connected to the earpiece.  It's just a friction fit and slides through a rubber peg with a hole in it.  Guess what, it doesn't stay if you get it sweaty.  Even though I haven't used it for months, it still won't stay attached and I actually lost it inside my car the other day when it came apart and fell off my ear.  It might stay in my ear with just the rubber grommet around the speaker but it's torn and very uncomfortable for any extended time.I guess, if it fits your ear, and you don't get sweaty, and don't use the built-in clip to attach it to your clothing it will work fine for you until you need customer service from the company.  Mine just sits in the console of my car most times and I hand-hold the phone.
B002JMALHE	Immediately upon using this unit (replacement for identical Z9i that I lost), I noticed the battery life was less--far, far less. I made do for a while, maybe a month or two. Now, I have no battery life at all--maybe 1 or 2 minutes--after a full charge. I was quite satisfied with my original Z9i. The battery life was sufficient. What do I do now? Amazon, you're a pretty stellar outfit. Do you want to just send me a new one? It feels weird to purchase yet another one when I have a nearly new one on my kitchen counter--albeit with a stone cold dead battery...
B002JMALHE	this bluetooth did not fit my ear comfortably.  It would constantly fall out of my ear at the worst times.  I did not use it long enough to comment on the voice quality gave it to my wife and she lost it.  I think it fell out of her ear too.
B002JMALHE	Nice headset works well. I like the headset you actually forget you have it on
B002JMALHE	Was trying to decide between Jawbone and Blueant and looked at the previous reviews.  The Jawbone had too many negative reviews for me so decided to go with Blueant.  I have had nothing but positive feedback on conversations and I can tell everyone hears me perfectly.  I updated the firmware soon after I received it and that was easy as well.
B002JMALHE	I read the mixed reviews and decided to take my chances.  I thought this was a great little headset the first day that I got it.  It paired quickly and easily with my blackberry 8200.  Although the sound quality on my end wasn't the best, the person I was speaking to said they heard me crystal clear.  That was until the 3rd day when the audio stopped working.  I couldn't hear anything.  I followed the instructions and rebooted my blackberry several times, deleted and repaired several times and nothing worked.  So I called Tech Support.  I was on hold for about 10 minutes (not a big ordeal since I read email during this time) and then they walked me through a reboot of the Z9i which subsequently didn't work.  Then they proceeded to tell me that they no longer make this device and they were going to send me some directions to return this and send me a new device.They said it would take a couple of weeks. I only hope the next headset works better than this one did.Good luck if you puchase a Z9i
B002JMALHE	Not bad at all, Was kind of hard to pair, I had to reset the device by pressing all 3 buttons, and the instrutions did'nt state that, I had to go online n do some researching.
B004GF91XC	The bluetooth arrived quickly.  However, I cannot hear that clearly from it and find myself putting my phone on speaker.  Also the piece is not comfortable in my ear.  I wont return it but I wish I could find one that you could hear out of clearly.
B004GF91XC	I would be totaly in love with this item if the fit was better.  The sound quality is great however it never feels secure and the hard plastic loop that goes around the ear seems easy to break.
B004GF91XC	I am extremely satisfied with this product. People on the receiving end of my phone calls while using this earpiece are unaware that I am using one and I can hear them clearly, as well! The piece is comfortable to wear, but I would love it even more if there was a smaller ear hook as it tends to get knocked off easily. I was impressed with how easy it was to pair it with my iPhone, and of course I love that it is available in pink!!
B004GF91XC	Great sound and easy to use, however, it has to be charged every night. I work night shift and charged it before I went to work, when I left work in the morning the earpiece was already dead.
B004GF91XC	This bluetooth is a great deal!! It fits in my ear perfectly, also, I have not had any problems with people being able to hear me or with me being able to hear them, volume is great, and the color is cute and stylish! Also, the battery lasts forever! I only recharge like once every 3 days.
B004GF91XC	its a good  mothers day gift i tryed it on after a while it gets kinda heavy other than that its easy to connect to any bluetooth phone
B004GF91XC	Great price but very uncomfortable, keeps slipping off and the hook is not adjustable.Another negative on this product is that it's big and no extra features.
B004GF91XC	Well, as a female, I do like the pink color. That's the first reason I chose this headset. When I got it, the functionality is also a value add to it.Pros:1. Long standby time. I made 4-5 calls a day, and it already lasted for more than 6-7 days (with high battery) without charging .2. Clear voice in hearing and speaking.3. Pair to my iphone and SamSung Glaxary Tab easily4. Easy to wear, even for a female with small ear hole like me, it fit on the ear perfectly. I can wear this just by one hand.Cons:1. The backgroud noise seems to be an issue, when calling, the others can hear my backgroud noise clearly. But it's not an issue when calling in a quite place.2. The size is a little bit big for a female user like me, but still acceptable.The overall user experience for this BT headset is great.
B004GF91XC	Fits my ear to a T, sound quality incoming and outgoing is purrfect, linked to my cellphone like a charm, found it easy to answer and hang up by simply holding the bluetooth with my thumb and middle finger and press the button with my index finger... don't need to press hard.  It's pink, $14.99 with free shipping, works great!! I Love it!
B004GF91XC	Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this because it was only $15 or so when I bought it and my husband spent $40 on his headset. But, shockingly, the little thing works great. The battery life is quite impressive, and it fits well in my ear and stays in place. The audio sounds slightly tinny but I don't notice it much and it's never interfered with the function in any way.
B004GF91XC	Perfect sound, great quality and I love the color! Only think is that it doesn't fit my ear properly and keeps falling out.
B004GF91XC	I have found the sound quality on this piece very good. I have no complaints about this at all. I would recommend it.
B004GF91XC	I paid $18 for it and it done its job good!I used this for 2 years and it gave out the other day
B004GF91XC	I replaced a 'Platonic' with this Motorola & couldn't be happier! I have no issues with difficulties such as hearing the call, or people hearing me, be in the car, or walking around inside-or outside. Can't beat the price!!
B004GF91XC	I received this yesterday. I'm very satisfied.  The price can't be beat.  The sound is great. Called a few people to check out the sound quality on their end, and everyone said it's good.  Definitely happy with the choice!
B004GF91XC	I am very pleased with this headset, it has worked great for me. People can hear me clearly and it is easy to put on and take off my ear. For the price I was surprised at how great it works.
B004GF91XC	I got this because it was pink and was priced more cheaply than other colors (I guess most people don't care for pink).  It works great MOST of the time. There are a few times when I've had trouble answering a call, possibly because of some unknown kind of interference. There is an amazing range of distance you can actually use this from the device. Just don't expect to leave your phone in the car while you go into a store (yes, I did that once).  Great hands-free device.  It's comfortable and not too noticeable (except when people think you are talking to them and not talking on the phone).
B004GF91XC	The product arrived in a timely manner.  I really like this bluetooth calls are clear on both ends.  Very convenient as well. My only complaint is it's a lil big, but once I got over that everything else is GREAT....lol.
B004GF91XC	Color is very nice but the sound is bad. When I'm talking through it, friends can't hear me really well and I have to use outdoor voice
B005HAYDRO	I purchased this for spare, just in case I loose one and to have some variety, but I never used them yet.
B005HAYDRO	Fits perfect with my Jabra Bluetooth. Fast delivery and the extra pieces come handy for spares. Only wish it came with a box or bag to store extra pieces
B005HAYDRO	Fits perfectly, in my ear and on the headset.  This is my second order of these things, on my last headset I superglued the thing on, I think I'm going to do it to this one as well.
B005HAYDRO	These were missing from My rebuilt jawbone era. I needed them for a better fit. I combines them with gel fit earpieces that slip on over these rings.
B005HAYDRO	Bought these for a friends jawbone. He says they fit perfectly and are so much more comfortable than the old one.
B005HAYDRO	They are a good copy but not as sturdy as the genuine ones.Some may prefer that.but do the job well.
B005HAYDRO	Better than OEM at more money!  Works well with my ERA.  The XL is hard to get and I need more!
B005HAYDRO	Quick shipping and fits perfectly! Exactly what I needed for my earpiece. I was loss without my hands free earpiece and didn't want to have to purchase the whole unit again.
B005HAYDRO	They were for the ERA and I HAVE the one before that so It just doesn't  work for my bluetooth
B005HAYDRO	It's a good thing that I ordered these because I broke my ear hook the other day. Also I only had one size ear tips before this.
B005HAYDRO	I take it! I use it! I am happy!Very hight quality! I use it with my jawbone era. Very comfortable sit in my eye and I dont need nothing just 1 earbud. I dont use earhook now
B006Q519PI	There is nothing wrong with these. They fit my Plantronics Discovery 975 just fine, more comfortable than the ones that it came with.SEVEN DOLLARS for three little pieces of rubber. Which, quite frankly, are not even very well manufactured (there are rough edges from the molding on it). For SEVEN DOLLARS these had better be perfect. Or at least more than three.SEVEN DOLLARS. Go get it on eBay for 50c.
B006Q519PI	We ordered this for our Bluetooth headset as a replacement to the ear buds that we lost.  Works as advertised. Good quality.
B006Q519PI	These are replacement buds for my bluetooth devices as they were out or get damaged.  They fit well and keep my devices functional.  I am quite happy!
B006Q519PI	These cusions are better than the set that came with my plantronic BT earpiece.  I wish I would have ordered earlier.
B006Q519PI	Great I would prefer all small one. The larger ones seem to hurt my ear. Still a great product. Thanks
B006Q519PI	Fits great, i used the small one for my little ears. I have a Samsung HM3500 that my dad gave me with no speaker cover ( or ear bud) piece but it still had the loop that goes around the back of the ear. These bud covers work well for this bluetooth. I looked at the original to make sure that the ear buds were identical or mostly that way; which they were except the loop was a bit thinner but still work great for a replacement bud.
