8199900164	Replacing dead charger that came with my phone. This one comes apart at wall plug end to reveal a USB as well. While this is probably standard for newer, smarter phones than mine, it was an unexpected but pleasant surprise since the original did not do this.
8199900164	This particular charger is much sturdier and reliable than the piece of junk that I received when I originally ordered the phone from Sprint. A highly recommended model.
8199900164	There was dirty, sticky stuff (i'm not sure what) stuck to the port (the part you put into the phone).  The wire and plug were also dirty.  The product was in very poor condition.  I do not recommend buying from this seller.
8199900164	didnt work at all!!!!!! never buying from them again!!!!!!!!!! i would not even give it one freakin star... i  went and bought one from hastings because this one sucks
8199900164	not exactly as shown goes from the part that plugs into the phone to a usb end then goes into the 110 volt adapter not a big deal shipped quick and accurate and is working fine
8199900164	as i said in the title..  its cheap and it works. what else do u need from a charger. i have had it for a couple of months and no problems yet.
8199900164	Our original charger was not working, so we ordered this. It came on time. Works fine and cheap too. Recommend this product
8199900164	bought this for my phone and it didnt work. the phone beeps on and off and doesnt work when charging.
8199900164	This charger does what it is supposed to with no problems noted.  Quality is good and I would buy another one if I needed it.
8199900164	Even with their warehouse in NY and an order placed just before Hurricane Sandy, they made every attempt to inform me of potential delays, but it arrived on time just the same!
8199900164	I worked perfect for my rumor 2, and it came in GREAT condition. I will buy more for back ups!
8199900164	Works some of the time.  The charger had stopped working for a few days but seeems to be okay now.  Seems to have a mind of its own.  Lol.....
8199900164	This is a great charger made by LG, not a generic company.  It works well for my old phone (rumor2), but it also works well for many other phones, including HTC evo and Samsung Galaxy.  Good price.  I bought 2 of these to keep as extras so I don't have to unplug the main one at home.
8199900164	This charger is cheap, so you gotta expect that maybe it won't work. I got mine in the mail, plugged it into my phone and nothing-no power. So I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one, I didn't even have to send the other one back. So instead of giving something a bad review and complaining, try contacting the seller first-on any product!
8199900164	I'm perfectly happy with my charger. It works perfectly and was a terrific price. Better quality than I expected for the couple of bucks it cost. I've noticed no difference from the charger that came with the phone. I have no complaints.
8199900164	Not only does this charger fit my Rumor 2 but it also works with my Galaxy Fascinate. Much cheaper to buy the combo pack than to purchase the items therein at a retail outlet such as Radio Shack or Walmart
8199900164	A couple of our original chargers bit the dust. Sprint's prices were ridiculous so I decided to try this one. It has worked well since we received it. It seems to charge the phone a bit faster.PS 9/2012. It outlasted my phone.
B000FLWC8C	I bought the SD7500 series phone after the long wait between the CES announcement and the actual release.  While I have a couple of small gripes about the phones (quiet speakerphone, rounded base doesn't allow phone to stand on its own, cheaper than expected build quality) the features of the system are outstanding.  The wireless camera works well (although it needs to be in relatively close range to the phone base station to work - had to relocate mine from where I wanted to have it).  This product - the bluetooth accessory, works perfectly and is a great way to access your cell phone calls when at home without having to keep a phone in your pocket all the time.
B000FLWC8C	It took me about 5 minutes to set this up, and it works exactly as advertised.  Now I come home and place my cell phone on my desk and don't have to worry about its location for the rest of the evening.  I assigned a different ringtone for cell calls, but once I receive a call I sometimes forget if I'm on the cell or the land line.I subtracted a star because the charger does not fit my RAZR V3m.  One would think that they would be pushing this product towards somewhat tech-savvy people, but it doesn't charge miniUSB (it has long thin connectors-I forget the name of them-that would've been perfect for me about 3 cell phones ago).
B000FLWC8C	I bought this phone system (base + extra b/w extension) over the summer specifically because of the forthcoming bluetooth cell dock.  After waiting for months, it finally came out late fall.  Bluetooth is difficult to set up on my Motorola cellphone (if any cellphone should be easy, it should be one made by the same company).  Dock doesn't work as a charger for my phone.  I rarely use it because once it is set up, it then becomes difficult to revert to landline calls.  Should have probably returned it.
B000FLWC8C	I finally found a phone that is designed for users, not geeks!  Every thing about the phone is intuitive so the manual really isn't necessary (as opposed to many things that I own that need a manual but do not ship with one).  The address book feature is easy to set up and use.  Other phones I have had in the past required me to remember a two digit number to recall an address book entry - this phone has a central list of names I can scroll to.  This address book is available to all phones on the system.  Also, there is a bluetooth connection to my cell phone so when I come home I simply put the cell phone near the base station and press the bluetooth button.  While I am home, if anyone calls my cell number, it rings through the system phones.  I can even dial out using the cell phone from any of the handsets in the house.  My only negative comment is that the voice quality seems a bit "tinny" at times but otherwise I think it is a very good product.
B000FLWC8C	This accessory is useful. The dock cannot be used to charge all Motorola phones. I have a SLVR phone and I can't use the dock to charge it. But overall, there a enough functions on the dock and it can be adjusted pretty straigthforwardly. The "connect automatically function" isn't that great especially when you come back home talking to the phone. It transfers it automatically to your homephone while you're talking... I prefer the manual mode!
B000FLWC8C	I bought this piece for my Motorola phone system because I sometimes work at the house and my office is in the basement. I have marginal cell coverage as it is so the cell is dead in the basement. This has allowed me to get the calls and I can answer them using the home phone system..how cool is that.  sofar it has worked great and I'm not going to give it up without a fight....excellent.
B000FLWC8C	I've had one of these for more than 6 months, to connect a Moto PEBL into our phone system.It works very poorly.  Making outgoing calls is fine, but every once in a while when an call comes in we pick up using a handset but can hear nothing and neither can the caller.It cannot be used to charge the PEBL.Another problem is that it interferes badly with our 802.11b WiFi system (it effectlvely disables a wireless music streaming device in the same room).  We've unplugged it; I wish I had returned it.
B0010K5AWW	What a deal! I think I paid about 2.50 for this charger and it was perfect! charged the phone up really quickly and have had no problems whatsoever
B0010K5AWW	When we were given this phone to replace our broken one I thought I was given a bad charger because it wouldn't stay plugged in... it would fall out. So I decided to order another one. This one didn't stay in either. The cord itself looked good, etc. so I don't know what the problem was. It's too bad because I LOVED this phone!
B0010K5AWW	Purchased for my 15 year old who is constantly breaking or losing phones.I decided not to purchase him a new phone, but gave him one of our old ones.The cord no longer worked, but I was able to find it on Amazon for a couple bucks.Great deal - love Amazon!
B0010K5AWW	A small but necessary element for home and travel. Definitely helps to have multiple units handy.
B0010K5AWW	This charge is to replace one that some how went away. It was great finding one here since the cell phone store was clueless. I believe it works better than the old one, since it seems to charge quicker with this one.
B0010K5AWW	Very flimsy product. The charger has been  replaced many times. Still get a junk one off here and they break sometimes as I take them out of the box. Very low quality.
B0010K5AWW	This is good for a temp replacement charger.  It makes a noise when you plug it in.  I'm afraid to have it pluged in when nobodies around, fearing that it will start a fire, but thats probably me just being paranoid.  It doesnt charge as fast as the charger that came with my phone, but it works.  Also the cord was shorter than i expected.
B0010K5AWW	Excellent product! Received the product in a timely manner! Well worth the price! The second one will come in handy when we travel. ;o)
B0010K5AWW	It didn't work for my phone. I ended up having to get a new phone because it wouldn't charge. it might have been the phone but it sucked
B0010K5AWW	My charger broke and my battery was dead, went to Verizon and purchased a new one and it cost over $35. I searched on amazon and purchased this one. Wish I could of taken the other one back to store. Next time I will know to look here first for anything that I buy. Thank you
B0010K5AWW	I am very pleased with my can be done in the house. Just love it.harger, now I don't have to go out to my truck anymore and charge it, it c
B0010K5AWW	Worked out perfect!!! And I also love that it can be charged with using the computer! So I would def recommend.
B0010K5AWW	My daughter needed another charger, and this is exactly what she needed. It works well, I hope she doesn't need another one. If so Amazon here we come.
B0010K5AWW	Charger did not plug well into phone, power light did not light up when plugged in.But if you needed an emergency shoelace, this might be just fine.
B0010K5AWW	Realy like it, but the cord is short. It is still working fine.it fits fine though.worth the money good value.
B0010K5AWW	I love it, it works, it was really, really cheap, and has kept my old phone working until I can afford to get an upgrade :D
B0010K5AWW	Cord was shorter than normal :( Maybe damaged and repaired? Works well. Hopefully, this one will last longer than my original one :)
B0010K5AWW	Works great with my ridiculously outdated phone.  Charges it up very quickly.  So glad I bought this charger.  Thank you.
B0010K5AWW	This wall charger was something I needed to charge my cell phone.  My phone charged fully for at least two hours.  I would recommend this wall charger to anyone.  I plan to use this charger over and over again.
B0010K5AWW	we use this phone as a back up...found in our drawer of lost phones, and I bought the charger since the old one was lost or thrown out.  So glad they carry older accessories.  thanks
B00508I3UQ	Works fine, have had it for a while now and I like that I can use it to connect to car chargers and my computer.
B00508I3UQ	Great product, works excellently well. Looks and works like the one that came with the AT& T phone. I recommend with high confidence
B00508I3UQ	My charger stopped working and didn't want to pay the AT&T price for a new one.  This is exactly the same for so much less!!
B00508I3UQ	Bought this for my son's HTC Vivid and he says it's the best charger he has - works faster and the phone holds the charge better.  Excellent product!
B00508I3UQ	this charger is very good- it charges as fast as my original charger. my other charger took forever to charge my phone. this was worth the $$$
B00508I3UQ	Exactly as described. Charges phone very fast & complete !
B00508I3UQ	This OEM charger is well and comes with the original logo.  It works with phone and charges it to full capacity quickly.  I would order again.
