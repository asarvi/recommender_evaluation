B000BWEN8M	Like hundreds of other people I own a G4 PowerBook whose aluminum is pitting on the wrist rest area from wear. Despite this fact, I love my 12" PowerBook and so I was looking for a way to protect my computer from further damage. This is just what I was looking for! The wrist rest protector fits perfectly over the entire area and covers all of the pitting so that my hands won't do further damage to the metal. It also looks great - I would say it is quite stylish. The gray color compliments the metal and it is specifically designed to allow the laptop to close without any problems. The keyboard cover is also a great addition because it fits perfectly over the keyboard and will protect the screen from the keys when the laptop is closed. I highly recommend this product to anyone who owns a 12" PowerBook and is looking for a way to protect the metal or the screen from wear. Great fit, great look, great product.
B000E77I1S	This clip is so cute and very easy to attach to phone.  I think it is great for children especially little girls.  It gives them I an "I'm a big girl now" while still keeping the innocent image.  I LOVE IT for my niece.
B000E77I1S	I bought the heart faceplate for my daughters firefly phone and it is cute as can be.It was very easy to install.She loves it!!!
B000XKOKW6	This stylus works great and has a great price.  Great deal.  It looks very sleek and has multiple options to fasten.
B002QOLBN8	The stylus is identical to the stylus that came with my LG phone. Why it is being called "retractable" I have no idea. It snaps into it's own cap that is attached to the phone. No retracting is done. The price is a little high for a hard piece of plastic in a fake leather cover but it is a nice stylus and I would rather have it than not. The problem I had with the first stylus that came with the phone is the "string " that attached the stylus cap to the phone. My  guess is that this one will also be a problem because it is the same material but it is a small price to pay for such a great phone and  comfortable stylus.
B002QOLBN8	The stylus I ordered was identical to the one I lost.  Could not have worked out better!
B002QOLBN8	This was just a described and is an exact replacement for the original thatI lost.  Glad I ordered two.
B005D673Z6	This is not the HTC flyer stylus that works with the built-in flyer stylus app. The flyer stylus uses a AAAA battery.
B006LUT7S4	After ordering two kindle fires, I felt like a stylus might come in handy, so I priced them.  I got seven of them for the same amount one would cost in a store.  Bravo!
B006LUT7S4	Bluecell Pack of 7 Color Universal Touch Screen Stylus Pen for Ipad 2 3 Ipod Iphone 4 4S 3g 3gs Motorola Xoom Kindle Fire Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 7.7 8.9 10.1 Blackberry Playbook HTC Flyer Evo View Tablet Sony Playstation PS Vita + Free Cleaning Cloth. This is a good product,  it arrived when it was promised.  The different colors help me keep track of where I put them.  They work really well.  I am happy with the product.
B006LUT7S4	I have ordered this item and it isnt what I expected. Compare to similar items this one was cheaply built from aluminum and it doesnt work on my iphone, ipad or droid screen. before you buy please make sure do research. sometimes a price is too good to be true. order 7 set for about $5. very cheap item and a waste of money.
B006LUT7S4	These are the greatest basic stylus! I enjoy having the variety of colors to match cases as well. The quality is great; don't let the price fool you. These work like a charm for web browsing, reading, typing, etc. on my Kindle Fire. Great value!
B006LUT7S4	these stylus work well...Everyone wanted one when they saw them...it sure makes texting and gaming alot easier..not sure how I made it without them...delivery was super fast and price was great... thank you
B006LUT7S4	When I had originally ordered my Kindle Fire, I purchased a single, slightly more expensive stylus, figuring one tablet only required one stylus so might as well get a good one. What I did not expect was one of my children pulling on the clip and the other one chewing on the tip whenever they could get their mitts on it. Within 24 hours the clip had been bent off and the tip chewed off. Simple logic would say not to let the kids touch it, but I purchased the tablet to use as a family and I don't want fingerprints all over the screen. So I decided to get a multi-pack of screen pens and chose this brand based solely on price and quantity.What I got was a far superior stylus. The clips are thicker and are very difficult to bend up and the rubber tips are very secure. I have two that I allow my children to use and I do not see these getting destroyed anytime soon. I could have easily bought a smaller pack and been just as happy, but now I have enough to match my mood with any color.Good price, worth more!
B006LUT7S4	All 7stylus pens arrived they work great all diffrent colors shippingwas free and they arrived on time only problem i have is the item description said 7stylus pens+ cable tie and i never recived the cable tie.
B006LUT7S4	These are great for what they are.  They are cheaper stylus, but I knew that going in.  We gave these as a gift to all our faculty when they were issued iPads and so far I have had no complaints.
B006LUT7S4	These are very useful as they keep those annoying smudges off the screen. They work on my kindle fire, my mom's ipad, my cell phone, and my nintendo 3ds. (Basically any touch screen)  I have found that they are particularly useful when using a keypad to type. I never use my kindle without one. With a pack of 7, there is always one close by and ive even given a few away. (My family loves them too.) I'm a huge fan of the fun colors. I was very impressed with the fast shipping. A great by at a great price.
B006LUT7S4	As a woman who has fingernails, I just couldn't use my smartphone. Someone I knew showed me a stylus, but in places like Best Buy, OfficeMax, Staples, etc. they wanted in the $15-20 range for just one stylus -- that is exactly like these. Instead, I got seven of them for half of that cost! This is the second batch I've ordered. I've given them to my women friends who have the same problem with their smartphones (and tablets). I gave one to my nail tech, and the salon ordered some for their other patrons. As a woman, it's the only way to use a touch screen. Even my husband uses one when he's playing games on his phone! Highly recommended.
B006LUT7S4	I love the colorful stylus!  I play lots of games and do texting. I've heard people comment about "fat finger" errors when typing. It made me laugh because I too would hit the wrong place when typing.  The stylus is a handy tool (and pretty too) for games and texting on my iphone and Kindle Fire. [Yes, I have Apple and Android. The best of both worlds!]  The stylus is fun and I can see the screen better on my iphone without my "fat fingers" blocking my view. I've placed multiple orders for this product. When a relative or friend comments about them, I give them one.  It's an inexpensive gift and they think of where it came from when the use it. :)
B006LUT7S4	My wife (now with our Lord Jesus) bought these several years ago.  I use the blue on my Kindle and she used the gold on her Asus (which I started using).  Unfortunately I accidentally broke the holder clip on mine and started using the green one.  The others are sill in the plastic they came in.  I'm 70 and I really believe these are going to be here long after I am not.  IF I would have to purchase more this is what I will be purchasing. - Bobby Blue
B006LUT7S4	Finally, a winner from blues cell.  How did they get these right, who knows.  They all work and the ends don't stick as reported by some reviews.  Yes plastic Barrels and clips on  ends, but they are lite and easy to carry.  Comfortable in the fingers and glide  wellon my I-pad3 screen.  (Note all styluses get a little graby in time because theywear their protective Manu. Film off, but a little plastic protective like armer-all will restore that glide back to like new proformence),
B006LUT7S4	Love them.  It seems the keys are so small, I can usually hit two at the same time so the stylus really prevents that.
B006LUT7S4	I received my items but one of the pens was broke. I didn't return because I didnt want to wait another 30days for another shipment. Other than that, the pens work well. Thanks
B006LUT7S4	Styli, with style. Although I have lost my favorite color, (blue), one can NEVER have too many styli. word word
B006LUT7S4	Beautiful.colors but.not sturdy at all One tip fell off right out.of the package. I had hoped for better quality. They don't hold up for long.
B006LUT7S4	A great littleinvention!!! I am the envy of all my friends and could have sold a 100 if I'd had them!!!
B006LUT7S4	The tips on these stylus are ineffective, need to be sturdier, they are a good size though they don't work as well as they should, guess you get what you pay for.
B006LUT7S4	Considering that these little gadgets only last so long; this is a great value. When I think of the stylus price I paid when I first bought my tablet (the first which I promptly lost and the second which lasted no longer than these), I wish I could get that money back. They come in a fun color assortment, and they're good to have around for family members in case they lose theirs.
B006LUT7S4	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these Stylus pens and they are an awesome deal!We have 3 different tablets and they work perfectly on all of them. No one had to "fight" after what color they wanted because there were so many to pick from so everyone is happy..:)Great price! Great deal! Great find!! A MUST have for any tablet user i think.I would definitely buy again and recommend it!A+++++ product
B006LUT7S4	There is nothing negative that I can say about these stylus!!!!  I have used them on a Toshiba Thrive, iPad2 and HTC Incredible 2 phone.  These stylus work amazing on all devices I have used them on!  These Bluecell stylus work better than the Griffin Stylus that I have also used; MUCH smoother!  There is some inconsistency in the nib height from one color to another in the pack I received, however that does NOT impact performance at all.  I like these so much that I'm going to be ordering a 2nd set for friends!  If you have a touch screen device and are considering a stylus these are simply OUTSTANDING!
B006LUT7S4	Love the colors but these seem to be a bit big for my iPhone. They work great with my iPad!! My pink one already lost the ring on the bottom. The little bubble doesn't stay in place without the ring. So I'm down my favorite color!
B006LUT7S4	I bought these to use on my iPad. I play DrawSomething.  At first they worked great, however, after a few weeks, I noticed they grabbed the surface of the iPad making it difficult to draw.  After three weeks, they were all seven unusable because they stuck to the surface.
B006LUT7S4	this stylus is a great size, I have it hitched to the side cover of my ipad and use it all the time!
B006LUT7S4	Stylus was not durable enough to last. Did not pay much for them. You get what you pay for. Bad deal.
B006LUT7S4	So far so good. Works well and rubber tip is holding up. Glides easily on phone and does not marr. I would like it 1/2 inch longer to fit my hand better but it's not bad for the price.
B006LUT7S4	this item is a piece of junk. I guess you get what you pay for. the soft rubber ends on four of the pens slipped up inside the barrel. if they cost more I would send them back. instead they went into the garbage where they belong.
B006LUT7S4	I bought 2 packs, gave one to each of my grandchildren.  I have one in every room I play games on my iphone also it's great for fast texting.
B006LUT7S4	My principal blessed my first grade classroom with an iPad2 lab. I like all the handwriting apps that are available for kiddos but felt that students should be using something similar to a pen/pencils when writing. So, I opted for this set of styli(?) because it was the cheapest for the most. They're great. One thing not mentioned in the product description is that the stylus is metal so it sticks to the magnets in the smartcover (that is, if you have a smartcover). Great deal! I always brag about the price I paid for them ($10) on Amazon :)
B006LUT7S4	I love these things! I bought them fir my kindle fire because even though it has a screen protector I hated putting my fingers all over it. I think one thing that makes these pens better than other styluses is that the tips are rubber. I've given some of them away to family members they use it for the iphones and one person even uses it for their PS vita with no problem. i love the colors as well. Lastly you can't beat the price similar pens even for a pack of two are more expensive than this pack of seven.
B006LUT7S4	vivid colors, good price for number received, fast delivery.  Works great with my Kindle Fire. Would recommend highly on all levels
B006LUT7S4	I BROUGHT THESE 7 COLOR PACK TO GIVE TO FRIENDS AND THESE ARE A BIG HELP IN HANDLING WITH YOUR 3G OR 4G PHONE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.
B006LUT7S4	these things only last for two months.  Not for long use. The tips wear out way too fast. I would not recommend.
B006LUT7S4	Most of them have gone missing.  A daughter took some, a son took some, a husband took some.  I have the red one.
B006LUT7S4	Dont ever get these from a local store. I can get packs of 5 or 12 for next to nothing and they get delivered from Hong Kong in just a few days.Only drawback......a friend tells me they are too soft. I dont agree and have never had a problem.
B006LUT7S4	After looking at the reviews and comparing prices, I decided to take a chance on these. I'm not disappointed so far. The colors have a metallic hue to them and they work on my iPhone 4s and iPad 2 great. I've heard about the tips breaking off on some, but that hasn't happened yet. If you go to an office supply store, you'll find ONE of these with similar construction (about an inch taller though) for almost double the price you'd pay for this pack of SEVEN. For the price, even if one did break, I have 6 more to burn through. These would fit an average sized hand. They are about 5" in length.
B006LUT7S4	These work on both my Kindle Fire and my wife's I-pad.  Maybe it's just me but I always seem to be touching the wrong icon when I use my fingers.  The stylus is a nice solution to that little problem.  Seven stylus for under seven dollars is a good deal.  I have had no problems with the tips either sticking or falling off.  I have fairly large hands and find the size is slightly smaller than perfect for me but I will adjust.
B006LUT7S4	These stylus pens works well with devices, good colors, good price per pen... Finally I won't be always searching for a pen!
B006LUT7S4	Good and cheap product, about $1/pen is a good deal. They are a little short and slippery, but they get the job done.
B006LUT7S4	They function extremely well. Keeps your tablet screen smudge-free. They work great on Kindle Fire.I have the $11 Amazon Basics Stylus that I rarely use, because I use these now.
B006LUT7S4	I've had several of these stylus'.  Most have been fine.  Three of them, however, have not held the tip out.  In other words, the tip ends up inside the tube.  Sometimes I've been able to pull it back down but it doesn't stay put.  Next time I'm going to pay a little more for, hopefully, higher quality.
B006LUT7S4	I have big fingers and need a stylus for my iPad, iPhone, and Fire. However they run about 10 to 12 dollars each in the chain stores, these are a good inexpensive replacement supply. I keep one on a lanyard around my neck as I can never find one sometimes when I need it. Good buy for the money.
B006LUT7S4	I had so much trouble using my finger on my new smart phone I felt stupid.  This works like magic and got me texting and using email which is exactly what I needed.
B006LUT7S4	If you don't mind waiting about a month for this to ship from Hong Kong then order these. The product is cheaply made but I already knew that and realize this is why the cost was cheap to begin with.
B006LUT7S4	I sure wouldn't purchase this brand again.  It's like using a balloon. Cheap stuff isn't worth it. I cant believe you number the words needed
B006LUT7S4	Knowing how simple these little capacitive styli are to make, I've been appalled at the prices of these things in the big box office supplies retailers.  A search on Amazon back in 2011 turned up some for $1.00 each, which were OK, but flimsy, and took over a month to arrive from Hong Kong.  These little styli from The Friendly Swede are a bit more expensive, are much better quality, and still perhaps 10% of the cost of one from an office supplies chain store.  This is a great deal, especially when one takes advantage of the discount from the retailer on an additional pack of them.  I highly recommend this product.
B006LUT7S4	My wife and I have several touch devices and I wanted to get a few extra pens.  The one I had was working well but wanted to have a spare in the event we lost one or the tip wore out.  I noticed that the Bluecell had a pack of seven for a decent price.  These work better than the $14 name brand pen I had previously purchased.  The pens slide smoothly across the surface of both our Ipad and Kindle Fire.  They are much lighter and slightly smaller than our previous pens.  They are built very solid - have a strong feel.I highly recommend these pens.  Tested on Ipad, Kindle Fire, LG 800.  All with great results.  Also worked well on devices with protector film as well as the bare screen.
B006LUT7S4	I had purchased the Blue cell Pack of 7 stylus universal touch  after  I HAD GOTTEN My KINDLE 3 G  AND i Just Love the stylus, it is a good product for a touch screen device, I am glad that there were 7  blue pack of 7 because I had the opertunity to share them with a few family members , they like them very well. I ordered them from Amazon.com
B006LUT7S4	I totally love these things. I originally ordered 3 - then 3 more then even more. They are so worth every penny and more. I give them out as gifts - better than candy!!! Everyone loves them.
B006LUT7S4	Stylus are great & love the colors. But why the hell am I missing one stylus?! I thought it came with 7, not 6!!! Plan was to give out some stylus to my family. We had it all planned out who gets what color. But now i guess one family member won't be getting a stylus because of the incomplete set. I didn't get what I paid for. Yes, I understand that this is a great deal price for the amount of stylus that you'll be getting. But its not great if they don't give you what you pay for. First time getting incomplete service shopping on amazon.
B006LUT7S4	What a great deal. They are of good quality and fits nicely in my iPad case. I've had enough to share, now I will need more for me.
B006LUT7S4	I got these for my T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S phone. They are just as good as the expensive ones, which means no need to spend the extra money. Love that there's 7 colors to pick from. I'll have these forever!
B006LUT7S4	This was a great product for the price. I gave them to my grandkids for their Ipods and then kept one for myself. It's always nice to have a spare..
B006LUT7S4	They worked great. I leave one in my office, in my car, at home and one for my pocket book.
B006LUT7S4	Definitely works well with my ipad 2, along with the touch screen of a blackberry. Love the colors and am quite happy with the purchase price. When I lose all of these, I will purchase again.
B006LUT7S4	They work great for me. Keeps the fingerprints off the screen. I have ghost armor and no issues. I would recommend  buying them.
B006LUT7S4	They are q good quality, the right size and there's 7. I have one on my headboard, one in the bathroom, one in my gym bag, one on my side table and 3 spare!!!!
B006LUT7S4	Really love these pens. They work great on my iPad 4, iPhone 5 & Kindle Fire. Have had them over a year & they are still working great!!
B006LUT7S4	I bought 2 stylus at $20 each during the first 6 months of having my iPad.  The tip fell off on both.  After I purchased the stylus' from Amazon, I could see no real difference.  I am still on the first one that I took out of the bag.  So far, so good!
B006LUT7S4	Thanks for offering such a good product. I would recommend these to anyone who owns a  Kindle,smart phone, or iPad.  The size is convenient and the colors are nice.
B006LUT7S4	The stylus are everything that I expected and more. Terrific to use and the reviews were right on. Purchase thru Amazon, which is always very good and dependable. I would highly recommend this stylus package.
B006LUT7S4	These styli work as good if not better that others at a fraction of the cost.These are a bargain.  They work great on my Toshiba Thrive.
B006LUT7S4	I've been using the same stylus on my iPad for a couple months now.  There's nothing wrong with these. Other reviewers have stated that these don't last, but they probably use then to clean out their ears or chew on the tips.  I love using a stylus to do my Draw Something drawings. Beats a fat finger.
B006LUT7S4	I bought the Bluecell 7 pack of stylus pens.  It's a great price for the pens and they work well. Great variety of colors. The only problem I had was that the tips came off easily, which caused me to go through the 7 pack pretty quickly.
B006LUT7S4	I keep a lot of stylus pens on hand. I don't lose as many as I used to but do occasionally misplace one only to be found later. I have one everywhere I go. Buy lots of them when the price is right!
B006LUT7S4	When I first received my Kindle Fire I ordered a stylus and a case. Well it didn't take my grand daughters very long to blow out the tip of the stylus. After shopping I decided to get these, different fun colors and lots of back ups. So far they are lasting  and maybe the girls have learned to use a lighter touch.Bluecell Pack of 7 Color Stylus Universal Touch Screen Pen for Ipad 2 Ipod Iphone 4,4S,Kindle Fire,3g 3gs, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 10.1, Blackberry Playbook HTC Flyer Evo View Tablet Bonus + Bluecell Cable Tie
B006LUT7S4	I love this item, I have a smart phone and it works great for texting and playing my games, I would recommend this product.
B006LUT7S4	At  this price these are an amazing buy. Stylus is terrific........lasts several months with almost constant use. I keep giving them out to envious friends and colleagues. Glad for the inexpensive multi pack so I have some for myself! If you hate a slimy screen or have long nails, these are a godsent. Go for it
B006LUT7S4	Only thing, I wish I had also ordered some tethers or lanyards, to help keep them together with my device(s).  Next order?  Getting the lanyards.
B006LUT7S4	The stylus pens work ok.  They don't always register the touch on an iPad screen, but work about 95 percent of the time.  The main problem we have with the pens is that only six of the pens were shipped even though we bought and paid for seven.  The seller doesn't have an option for contacting them so we are stuck not getting what we paid for.  It sounds like most people have had better luck than us, however we will make sure to not buy from this seller again since we didn't get what we paid for and have no way to get the situation rectified.
B006LUT7S4	Very pleased with these touch pens.  The colors are beautiful and they work great.  The only problem we had with them is trying to decide which color we all wanted to use.
B006LUT7S4	This is the first time I tried a stylus with my kindle fire. I like to use it when I am playing games.
B006LUT7S4	I bought these for my students to use because I don't like how grimy the ipad screens get with multiple kids using them. These did the trick, and the kids love them!
B006LUT7S4	I got them for my kids to use on the iPads and tablets in the house. They are somewhat cheaply made, but for the price I paid, they weren't that bad. They aren't the same quality you get in the expensive ones, but they do what they need to.
B006LUT7S4	I ordered these to assist in note-taking on an iPad. Quite simply, they're cheap. But I knew that when I ordered them. They don't last a long time, especially under many hours of daily usage (I type my class notes, and then draw diagrams or take math notes on the iPad with Notes Plus).I would order a lot of these, so they become somewhat disposable like pencils. That, or order a nicer stylus and enjoy the build quality of that for a long time, like I did.But I think these serve a purpose--I keep a few of these in my backpack, laptop bag, and go-bag, and I leave the nice stylus at home.
B006LUT7S4	they work nice if you have large fingers,  i dont  but its nice to have a pen  .thank you  convient
B006LUT7S4	One of the stylus broke, the rest have been working just fine.  I leave them all over my house so they are available no matter where the phone is when it rings.  We are new to 4G and fine the touch screen a challenge these have helped immensely.  The stylus also works on my Knook and added bonus
B006LUT7S4	For the price they are ok. Sometimes the rubber tip get slippery and wont grasp the letters or numbers on your Ipad.
B006LUT7S4	Bluecell Pack of 7 Color Stylus Universal Touch Screen Pen for Ipad 2 Ipod Iphone 4,4S,Kindle Fire,3g 3gs, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 10.1, Blackberry Playbook HTC Flyer Evo View Tablet Bonus + Bluecell Cable Tie Work just fine. Everybody wanted 1 of mine and where did I get them. The price was right, the shipping was more than I thought it would be!Thanks Again for a great product!
B006LUT7S4	Love the size and colors. Perfect for my tablet.Would buy again, and I will recommend these to all my friends.
B006LUT7S4	They are great! I love giving them for gifts and I can easily find them.  If you haven't used one try it!
B006LUT7S4	I got these to use with my Kindle and they serve the purpose well.  I love the different colors and I haven't had any trouble with the point as some of the others have.  I have been using them quite a while now.  For the price it is nice to have extra ones around in case a person misplaces one.  The shiny colors do make them stand out, though.  I may get a Kindle Fire later so the extra ones will come in handy then.
B006LUT7S4	These work wonderfully on my Smartphone and my Kindle.  It says for the Ipad but it works on everything great.
B006LUT7S4	I ordered many and love them.  Gave them out to friends and family.  Can't imagine going back to using the 'ol finger.  Much more fast and accurate.
B006LUT7S4	This stylus is a high-quality product, unlike some others that I have tried.  It is nicely weighted and a pleasure to use.  The set arrived promptly.
B006LUT7S4	I didn't pay a whole lot so but you get what you pay for! They are cheaply made they are hollow if you would step on one they would crush! The black part at the bottom just pushs in i have seen over pens that seem more soild i will not order from them again.
B006LUT7S4	More than half of the stylus pens fell apart  the rubber points fell off  what a disappointment  not worth buying the package of stylus pens
B006LUT7S4	I've purchased stylus' from a couple of different sellers. These work just find on the aforementioned items. Responsive and seem be equal to their more expensive counterparts on Amazon. Some people seem to have reported problems on certain devices, but they work fine in my case. And you really can't beat the price.
B006LUT7S4	These are great for my iPhone, and iPad. No complaints, and a great price! They are like the $20 and $30 dollar ones that I have seen at Target. They also work well with Android phones, I have given a few away to co-workers. Great for the Draw Something game, thats all the rage right now.
B006LUT7S4	These work excellent on the iPad, iPhone, and even the Macbook Pro touchpad!!!!  Just thought I'd try it and it worked!!!  For the price you cannot beat these.  Thanks!!!
B006LUT7S4	these sylus workout well.  I just wish that you had some with a smaller rubber tip.  I tend to get two letters at a time when I'm texting, otherwise they are ok
B006LUT7S4	i kept one, gave the rest to friends.. all of them were happy to be able to draw easily on draw something, a lot even took a picture of their own stylus to show off on their instagrams. hehe :]
B006LUT7S4	Very disappointed with this product. The rubber tips fell off easily. Two broke apart on first use. Very poor quality.
B006LUT7S4	I bought these to use on the ipad.  They are cheap quality, the rubber ends fall off so easily, we don't even bother using them anymore.
B006LUT7S4	these work great for the price compared to the other stylus carriers I got 7 for the price I would have paid for one here. Colors are nice. And I can always find a tleast one since their are 7!  :-}
B006LUT7S4	the product was all it said it would be.  They work great with my Kindle Fire for playing games.  Some of the games I played required you to high light areas and my finger would not always provide the required touch for the constant pressure.  The pens provide the required pressure for typing and high lighting in the games I play.
B006LUT7S4	Does the job well.  These would be nicer if they were made with a metal top, instead of plastic, to give the stylus more weight.
B006LUT7S4	They work just as described! I love them. Would buy again and probably will since they are easy to loose, just like pens. For me anyway!
