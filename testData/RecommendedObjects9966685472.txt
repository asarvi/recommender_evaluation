9866458083	I like that this case doesn't cover up any of the screen like alot of them do (it covers just up to where the speaker and sensor are leaving the front completely open), so that if you have a screen protector that leaves space for the sensor and speaker it won't interfere with it.  The belt clip wasn't included but I don't need it anyway. I have had it on my phone for a while and it fits well and hasn't fallen off. This was well worth the purchase price.
9866458083	Love the design but after awhile starting chipping hated that I had to give it up.  But well worth the buy.  Thank you
9866458083	I ordered this phone cover just over 3 months ago, and I was pleased when it arrived.  It is pretty and fit my phone perfectly, leaving all the important buttons and sensors uncovered as needed.  Within a couple of weeks, a small piece at the top splintered and broke off, but it did not affect the stability of the cover, so I was not bothered by it much.  Today, though, the piece of cover around the bottom of the front of the phone split in half, and it will not stay in place on the phone.  I know the cover was inexpensive, but it is annoying to have it break so quickly and to have to shop for a replacement.
9866458083	Was not happy with it.  Broke as soon as I put it on and phone would not close properly. Cheap plastic not worth it.
9866458083	I had been looking for a new cover for my phone and finally found exactly what I wanted. I have dropped the phone a few times since putting on this cover and it has held up perfect.  no breaks, chips, scratches etc.  it didn't even pop off like the one I purchased from Verizon.  Loved it so much I bought 2 more covers so I can switch them out when the mood strikes.Great super fast shipping also.
9866458083	I really liked the cover, but I only had it a couple weeks and the enamel started to chip away. Now the sides are clear where it chipped.
9866458083	It is pinker and prettier in real life.  However, it creaks some when you squeeze it, which is a little annoying.  But, for the price, I am very happy.
9866458083	I like the looks of the cover but in less than a week the small tabs that hold it onto your phone were breaking off- and I don't move the cover off and on. I guess you get what you pay for.
9866458083	This item was a very cute phone cover, I loved it when I got it. Sadly the first time I put it on my phone I tried to take the back off and it broke. So its kinda cheap that way you've gotta be careful taking it on and off. Other than that its a great phone cover.
9866458083	I bought this case for my wives new cell phone.  The case fits well over the phone and offers excellent side and back protection.  I purchased screen protection sheets separately to protect the touch screen. My wife loves the case as it dresses up the "boring" phone.  She does not use the belt clip as it is just tossed in her purse so I cannot comment on that.
9866458083	I just got this yesterday, so I can't testify to its durability, but I can tell you that it fits my phone well (maybe just a tiny bit loose on the front) and it looks so pretty!  Came with a belt clip, unattached, which is good because I wasn't planning to use it.  The spot on the back of the case where the belt clip is able to clip into looks weird.  That is my only complaint so far.  But other than that, I love it!!  And the pricing doesn't get much better than this!
9866458083	I was excited when I first saw my cell phone cover. It is pretty. But it had rough edges around it. And when I opened my phone, the back cover popped off every time. Then, less than a week after having it, I dropped my phone. The case broken into a couple of pieces. I have since purchased a different case for my phone. I haven't had a single problem with my new one. I would never suggest the pink flower one to anyone.
9866458083	I recived this product very quick in the mail and it was packaged very neatly it fits well and covers the phone very well!
9866458083	The case fits good and looks great.  I got it for my Mom for Christmas and she really likes it.  The colors are really pretty.
9866458083	I haven't had this very long, I hope that it doesn't break the first time I drop it.  My back cover used to pop off but that's because the back cover arrived broken.  Seller sent me out a new one and now it opens just fine.  A lot of other Env Touch case reviews mentioned that it covered up the sensor at the top but this one does not.  Overall it's definitly worth the money.
9866458083	ordered this as a gift for a friend, looks amazing in person had a small issue being damaged when recieved but they replaced it with out any questions and got it to me fast! thanks again and my friend loves it! fits her phone perfectly and has the belt clip! She loves it!!!!
9866458083	I had my case for less than a month and the tabs that hold the case onto the phone broke off.  All these cases are junk! I've gone through 3 in the past 6 months. They break and crack easily, the paint chips off and I was really angry when I took off the top panel and the case actually scratched the face plate of my phone... two thumbs down!
9866458083	Purchased this product for my daughter's phone.  It was shipped in a bubble envelope with no other protection and arrived broken.  Contacted the company who immediately sent out a replacement which arrived intact. The case is extremely thin and snapped in half within a day of being placed on the phone.  Definitely not worth the money.
9866458083	This product was broken when I received it so they sent me a new one which was also broken. It was also supposed to come with a clip and they forgot it both times. Was very disappointed.
9866458083	Lovely cover, exactly what I wanted. I've had it for seven months so far, still in reat shape. It is holding up nicely.
B001E90ICG	I love this case it creates a very sleek and feminine look  for my Iphone 3G. the picture is just as depicted very pretty pinks and white. It doesn't add bulk it still slides in and out of my pocket with ease and it fits very snugly, I have it with a screen protector and it is perfect for me. My phone is protected and looks cute.
B001E90ICG	I'm embarrassed to admit how many times I've dropped my IPhone...too many. This case protected it each and every time.  At times it's flown apart on impact, but I just snap it back together and go on my way.  I've received many compliments about it too.
B001E90ICG	I have tried several cases on my wife's iPhone 3G and until this one none had satisfied both of us. She had originally bought a plain, white rubber case at the AT&T; store which she liked for its protectiveness, but I thought was ugly. I then tried a black, textured case which was more elegant, but she didn't like black. Then I tried a Gelaskin print of a Monet painting, but she did not like how the edges of her phone were exposed to wear, and how the children could pick at and remove the screen protector.  And now we come to this, which miraculously she likes.[Update: my wife moved up to a 3G S and the case fits that as well and shows no signs of wearing out.]What to like:The artwork is beautiful and might be of a Chinese mountain flower for which my wife is named: the Mei flower. Or at least, it's quite similar, and I like the little bees.The case is extremely protective with nothing exposed which need not be exposed. It seems likely that a phone kept in this case, with a screen protector in place will look like new. Which is a big thing for a device worth several hundred dollars that gets thrown around with keys.The edges of the screen protector are not exposed, keeping them from being picked at by naughty children.What not to like:The two pieces of the cover are just snapped together and held with a ring of plastic tabs which do not appear will take much stress before popping open, but of course, they are equally easily popped shut.The slight ridge around the touch screen can impede quick finger access to the edges of the display, but not horribly so, and only someone with the stubbiest of fingers would find pixels inaccessible.
B001E90ICG	I got this to keep my iphone safe from my klutziness. It works although it does make my phone reasonably bigger. the scratch protect it came with does it job, it prevents scratches on your iphone but itself does scratch. the case cracked after i dropped it or tried to open it a couple times but it's stilldoing it's job. the included clip is to annoying to use because if you don't want it one there you must take everything apart and unscrew it.
B001E90ICG	The front of the case didn't have the same outline like the one in the picture (better in my opinion) You can reach the home button a lot better and the screen looks more open. Very nice case!
B001E90ICG	I like it-went on easily, pretty design, except one of the adhesives from the clear cover did not come off, so it took away from the look in the front of the Iphone.
B001E90ICG	Excellent prices, pretty cases, and super easy to put on the iPhone.  I like to provide some protection for my phone, so this is a great solution without the hefty price at the Apple Stores. :D
B001E90ICG	Great form factor case, great smooth and polished finish. Love the detail on the graphic. Only downside is the seal when you enclose the two pieces (front and back) together. It isn't seemless and does not provide the comfortable assurance that it won't split apart given enough impact to the phone.For the price though, it is SUPERB.
B001E90ICG	Fit perfect on my phone.  Love that it is different from other people's covers.
B001E90ICG	Product not the same as picture in structure but same in design. Still worked out ok and works fine.
B001EWL5U2	Perfect fit, easy install, makes the phone look like new. Make sure you have the torx tool to remove & replace the 4 screws.
B001EWL5U2	My mother-in-law cracked the caller ID glass on her Razr and this product fit the bill perfectly (obviously).  It is a bit cumbersome to install as you have to remove a few tiny screws for which you need the proper screwdrivers (they have them at Radio Shack) but it isn't too bad providing you don't lose the screws when you take them out!Once you successfully accomplish dissembling and reassembling the glass it looks perfect and you cannot even tell it was replaced.
B001EWL5U2	The glue for this item did not hold, but the fit was perfect and once we used our own glue, the cell phone looked like new!
B001EWL5U2	This product was a perfect match for my phone,  I tried getting the part thru a phone store.  It was not available.  The phone tech did however tell me how to replace the part myself if I could find it. THANK YOU AMAZON .com !!!!I watched a video on u-tube that told me how to replace it. It seemed to complicated for someone who is not tech friendly. I did it the way the phone tech instructed me & it all worked perfectly.Watching the u-tube video 5 times did give me the courage to try replacing it myself tho:-)The company suppling the part was Very!!! prompt I got my replacement part even before they estimated it would arrive.  Great service !! Would reccomend them to anyone needing parts. The price was so reasonable I bought two. That way I have one for backup.
B001EWL5U2	I bought an unlocked V3 on this site.  In less than a week I cracked the glass so I bought a couple of these.Picked the shards out through the front, no taking phone a part.  Rubbed thumb to remove old adhesive and stuck one of these on.  I have a spare on hand but the V3 stinks as a phone.  Not very sensitive.  It *may* be that I dropped it in the sink but I believe the V3 was not performing properly before that accident.  Anyway, I'm back to using some old Sony Z520's I scored on fleabay and very happy.If you need a new glass, this is a 5 star deal on delivery, fit, finish.Wes
B001EWL5U2	I bought this glass lense hoping that it would last quite a while or until I got a new phone, it didn't. It worked for the first couple of days, but then it broke as I was pushing on it to get an air bubble out. So if you want one for cheap, get it, but don't put it under any stress.
B002JSVCUS	I broke my clip due to heavy work activity and thought it was the end of my new case. Order these and they slip right on.
B002JSVCUS	Since Cellet stopped including this clip with their phone cases you have to purchase these separately.  This is one of a very few places where you can do that for a reasonable price.  The clips are, of course, correct and the price is reasonable but I was disappointed in the deliver time (nearly 2 weeks from a company in my own state?) and the price of shipping.  Shipping cost more than three of these (with tax).  I am left with the feeling that they are simply using shipping charges to inflate a low-ball price for the product?
B002JSVCUS	Very happy with the availability of the clips and that the Cellet cases have replaceable clips. The clips tend to break on holsters as a general rule.  This way you are not throwing out a perfectly good holster, all you do is replace the clip.  I purchased several as I have two phones in their own cases.
B002JSVCUS	The item shipped very quickly and the item received was the same as described. It was a replacement for the clip that broke on my Cellet Holster. The only negative thing I can say about this item is that I wished the clip rotated instead of staying in one position. That would decrease your chances of damaging the clip. However this is a manufacturing issue and not the seller. I would definitely order this item again from seller.
B002JSVCUS	Fit great and replaced old clip in seconds.I do construction work and sometimes I snag my phone case on stuff and break the clip.
B002JSVCUS	This clip for my holster was a perfect fit  so that I didn't have to buy another holster will buy again
B002JSVCUS	The spring broke on my old clip.  I was glad I could just replace the clip and not the entire cell phone holder.  And I ordered an extra one just in case.
B002JSVCUS	My pouch was still in good condition, so this worked out great. packing was first rate and was exactly what I was looking for.
B004FO1MR2	I have become addicted to Evernote. For a project that required collaboration via sharing notebooks. It rocks & at Amazon you save a couple bucks.
B004FO1MR2	Am I missing something?  Or do some people want to spend money for no reason?  Go to Evernote's website (the people who make it) and download it free.
B004FO1MR2	Evernote is a huge part of my life now.  I write all of my notes in Evernote and never have to hit the "save" button which saves me countless time just there.  Evernote also updates all of my devices at the same time - so my same "To Do" list or  "thought" can be found anywhere I happen to be.I have it on my Kindle, my phone, two computers and I never have to save anything on a flash drive to move it to other devices. I use to do all of my thoughts and writing on Word or note pad.  But Evernote does all of the same functions and much more.From Evernote I can even create an e-mail and send it. I will take a class about Evernote because I am sure I am still not using it to its utmost potential.
B004FO1MR2	I have used Evernote for a couple of years and when I saw the discounted version for the Premium service I decided to sign up for that too.  Best thing about the Premium service is the increased limits on individual uploads and total upload volume per month.  I really needed the extra storage on a monthly basis.  You also get other features like offline notebooks which I have not tried yet.This package is basically an empty box with the registration code to sign up for the Premium service.  Not sure why they just don't e-mail you the code instead of wasting a box by shipping it but oh well.
B004FO1MR2	It activated on my Android version w/out issue, and all the other platforms (Win,Mac,iOS,web) noticed next time I used them. Perfect! Cheaper than paying full price online.
B004FO1MR2	Since there seems to be some confusion: this is for a retail boxed product (which contains a small brochure with a licence code for a year's premium service.)
B005BNNBAW	Great product, does what is says, very versatile.  I use it in my truck to hold my iphone, it's design allows it to function for nearly any handheld device whether its in a protective case or not.  only one drawback its a two handed operation.  If you need to remove your iphone from the mount and/or return it to the mount while your on the road you have to pull over to do so.
B005BNNBAW	Exogear Exomount Universal Car Dash Mount (Fits All Smart Phones and Gps up to 5 Inches) WhiteExcellent, works as advertised, mounts to most any surface, horizontal or vertical. If the pad get dirty, a little mild soap and water on your finger will clean it right up. Don't dry with any type of towel, it will stick to the pad and make a mess, trust me. First saw this reviewed on GeekBeat.TV. One may not be enough, and they make great gifts, this is a must have. Use anywhere, by land, air or sea and at home. Its uses are only limited by your imagination.
B005BNNBAW	It has been wonderful, it sticks to everything just like they say, my car does not have a lot of flat surfaces but everywhere i stick it i will not come off, it also has a great grip on your phone, i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a universal mount for there car, and getting in on amazon is fantastic it is super easy and so much cheaper, this is the mount for you if you looking for a mount for your car.
B005BNNBAW	Absolutely amazing! Many cheap car mounts out there are ridiculously weak and fall off when you put then on the glass or whatever. This mount holds pretty much any phone nicely and never fell off even though I drove on gravel many times. 2 negative things about it is that it the phone shakes a fair amount when the road isnt smooth and also when you try to move phone into a different angle, it moves rather easily and makes me wish they made it slightly more sturdy so the phone wont move int to different angle too easily.  The angle of the phone changed slightly when my car went over some bumps.  Still an excellent product as the most important thing to me is that the phone does not fall off.
B005BNNBAW	This is the iPhone car mount I have been looking for. I tried a couple before and mounting and unmounting was clumsy. Bean-bag platforms for the dashboard are OK, but being able to stick the suction cup directly to my dash, and have it stick securely, is the way to go.
B005BNNBAW	Works perfect. The Suction Cup holds very well. The best thing about this product is no matter the size of your phone or type of case it's in this mount will hold it.
B005BNNBAW	everything was as it was shown on the the video :)sticks to almost every possible flat surface and phone stands firm in its clutches
B006M8G9IG	Wife loved these little bands to keep her phone one... She also liked the many different colors of the bands.
B006M8G9IG	I purchased this as a gag gift for my wife's birthday. She is always losing her iPhone. She got a kick out of it and started using it. However it broke within 12 hours. There is a small wire loop that allows the lanyard piece to attach to the iPhone adapter piece. This broke off and disappeared. However I was able to replace it with a small ring from a cheap key chain.You get what you pay for I guess and I can't complain too much about the broken ring. The other pieces seem solid enough.
B006M8G9IG	Inexpensive, secure & reliable, and easy to use. I was forever dropping my iPhone and I didn't like the bulky cases. This lanyard works great. I just attach it, put it around my neck, slip the phone in my shirt pocket, and no more worries about damage.
B006M8G9IG	I thought i was ordering a neck strap & received wrist straps. i've been using them & it's been okay
B006M8G9IG	I was a little concerned with the simple connection, but it holds the phone with no problem. No more hunting for the phone when you use this.
B006M8G9IG	It works really well for me.  If I attach to the cord to my iphone & leave the string hanging our of my purse, the phone can easily be pulled to the top.  No need to dig to the bottom of the purse to make sure you have your phone or dig to the bottom to find your phone when it rings.The thing I like least is that the iphone is a little to heavy for me to hang the cord around my neck.
B006M8G9IG	A lot of my clothes don't have pockets but I can still keep my iPhone 4S safe and convenient with this lanyard. I do wish it were adjustable in length as it was a little longer than I like it.  I made a knot in the top of the strap to make it the length I wanted.  It attaches securely so I don't have to worry about it falling off.
B006M8G9IG	I can now use this with my IPhone 4s and works perfect. Attaches without worry and delivered on time and packaged well. Will order again and again.
B006M8G9IG	This lanyard works well for what it is. I bought one for myself as a test before giving one to my mom as a gift. I tested it very thoroughly and there is no way that thing was coming loose. I actually ripped open the metal ring on the lanyard trying to pull it out of my iPhone before I realized there are squeeze-to-release buttons on the sides. My real issue was that it's just not comfortable to wear. The weight of the iPhone makes the strap uncomfortable around the neck, and the phone bounces around when you walk.
B006M8G9IG	I can wear my nano around my neck with out it falling off or getting caught in anything and its sturdy......shipment was quick.Thank you
B006M8G9IG	We have purchased two of these over about a month's time.  There is a small 3/8" ring that connects the dock connector to the lanyard.  That is the weak point of this unit and makes it ineffective to last very long.  A lanyard hanging around your neck keeps the phone or iPod from dropping -- good enough -- but it also gets tugged one once in a while.  This small ring has no strength and gives way.  On the second unit we bought, I replaced that weak point with the smallest spring steel keyring I could find.  After this modification, we have what it should have been in the first place.  It is now durable enough to last indefinitely.  Please note, this unit will not work at all with the newer Apple products using the lightening connector -- but will work with most portable Apple devices made in the previous 9 years, or so.  BUT be ready and expect to make the same modification to it that I did.
B006M8G9IG	I chose this product to prevent my iPhone from falling out of my shirt pocket onto the floor. It lasted two weeks, then came apart while on my neck, and my phone fell to the floor.
B006M8G9IG	Does it's job well.  Strong, Spring clasp is good for keys.  Chord a bit flimsy but adequate.  Not quite long enough to use phone while hung
B006M8G9IG	Everyone is asking where did I get it.  It works great.  Husband took it and now I need to order another
B006M8G9IG	I like it, but the phone is heavier than I expected. Therefor, the strap is hard on my neck. I think if the string was thicker it would be great.
B006M8G9IG	I bought several of these to have on hand for my family members with iPhones. They are well made and the clip that fits into your phone is nice and secure. It wont pull out by itself, nor does the weight of the phone cause it to fall out. You must actually pinch it to release it.
B006M8G9IG	This was perfect for my daughter, however the bottom part that holds the phone broke after 2 weeks.  Very disappointed.  Good concept just not made very well.
B006M8G9IG	Product as described.  I use it on my IPOD Touch 3rd gen. It is a tight fit. I worried if I would damage the connection on the IPOD Touch body. So far, so good.
B006M8G9IG	I just got it and it is awesome! It was easy to put in but seems very secure.  I will press the buttons on the side both to put it in and to take it out because there are little hooks on the side that seem to give it the added security when hanging.  The button make those retract in order to attach and detach from my itouch 4g.
B006M8G9IG	This clasp is a great idea. It was great zipped inside my hoodie. But when I took the hoodie off, my phone bounched around too much without being tucked inside the jacket...and I was just walking. It could never be used for running.
B006M8G9IG	I really like this product, I had seen someone with one and I asked where did they get it and they said they ordered it off amazon, so I got me one and I always know where my phone is now, great product and I would recommend it to my friends..
B006M8G9IG	I'm pleased with this lanyard. I do wish it was a little longer, and it seems to be made of ribbon instead of rope, so I don't know how durable it will be long term. That's why the four stars. But already, I'm in the habit of keeping it around my neck and clasping and unclasping my phone as needed.
