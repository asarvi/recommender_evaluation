B003BWT99M	Got this for my Nokia Lumia 710. The stand is a little too big when the phone is in a vertical/portrait position. If that's the only position in which you need to place your mobile device, it will work fine; tho, smaller phones will tilt to one side. I had in mind a stand that would let me place my phone in either a vertical/portrait or horizontal/landscape mode while in use. I didn't pay enough attention to the arms of the chair. These cause the phone to sit enough askew in landscape mode, which is usually how I use my phone, as to not be practical.It is well made & very nice looking. I will order more colors for other rooms in my apartment to have a place to keep my phone nearby & protected a bit from falls, scratches, etc., as well as not being misplaced. The 4 instead of 5 stars are due to its larger width.
B003BWT99M	It will hold your phone. Mine is a Samsung Galaxy S 3. It does what you would expect it to do. Color is slightly (very slightly) different pink than the picture shows. Not quite as bright.
B003BWT99M	I really like this chair but it is a bit narrow for my Droid Maxx HD.  I just set it sideways.
B003BWT99M	I like this cellphone holder is very cute. My daughter also loves it! Would refer to others in a heartbeat! Thanks.
B003BWT99M	Love this "director's chair" phone holder. Nice pin color & sturdy. I had some awesome phone holders, but when I bought my SAMSUNG IMPRESSION, it would not fit in any of them. I looked until I found this. Its perfect!
B003BWT99M	Great cell phone holder.  Wide enough that your phone doesn't fall out of it!  Great colors available and very durable.
B003BWT99M	Works great with my Galaxy III but it is much wider than it looks. I use it with my phone on it side and it fits perfectly!
B003BWT99M	Satisfied with this holder, but the color is not Hot Pink.. its more of a mary kay lighter pink.. Wife still likes it, so I don't have to ship it back.. I am happy ;)
B003BWT99M	This is perfect for holding my phone while working. It looks nice and allows me to see if someone calls without having my sound on.
B003BWT99M	This is actually wider than it looks. I have an iPhone, but this would easily hold BlackBerry or Galaxy. It works perfect and was exactly what I was looking for to hold my phone up, while on my desk.
B003BWT99M	I LOVE this color and love the functionality. It works for the sheer purpose of holding up your phone, you can't really do anything with your phone while it is in the holder, though.
B003BWT99M	I does what it's made to do.  It was a gift and she loved it!  Great for work or home.
B003BWT99M	I bought 3 of these for a few friends at work. We love them. It fits most phones and it comes in different colors
B003BWT99M	I wish that I had known about this sooner.  Now I can find my cellphone on my busy office desk.  It is a conversation piece and very noticeable.
B003BWT99M	Very cute--the  back is plastic and pink and the front looks like a synthetic leather... decent quality. and it's gonna do the job i bought it for so... AWESOME!
B003BWT99M	Happy with this pink &#34;chair&#34; cell phone holder. I have a large GSIII and it fits fine either in the vertical or horizontal position. :)
B003BWT99M	The product itself it very helpful. It holds my huge phone (Nokia Lumia 822) but the color is more pale than the picture shows. Also my phone has the charge plug on the bottom so in order to charge my phone while it is in the &#34;chair&#34; it has to be upside-down.
B003BWT99M	The material is hard plastic with a leather-look texture on the front, which is fine. I keep mine on my desk, and it's nice to be able to see messages that pop up while my phone (iPhone 4S) is on vibrate. If you wanted to prop up your phone to watch videos or take a call on speaker phone, this could work for that too. You could even prop up  your phone in a landscape position to watch a video if you wanted. So, it works exactly as expected. I think it should fit most phones; it's about 3.5 inches wide, and I have a protective case on my phone. There's plenty of room to spare.The only thing that disappointed me a little was the color. In the picture, it looks fuschia, like a dark pink. When mine arrived in the mail, it is a very, very pale, blush color, which surprised me.
B003BWT99M	I use my cell phone as an alarm clock and this stand makes it easier to view my phone and hitting my snooze button lol. It also makes it nicer to view the time without actually picking up my phone. It holds my phone perfectly and I love the color.
B006GVZWUK	A total waste. The holder would not hold to dashboard or window for more than a minute or 2. DO NOT BUY.
B006GVZWUK	This dashboard mount has been indispensable. It is extremely easy to install, and holds my iPhone very securely. I do not keep a cover on my phone, so I'm not sure how it would work with one, but it seems like it would accommodate one fairly easily. My one very small complaint is that it will "unstick" when the temperatures drop below freezing and the dashboard is too cold. It is so easy to reattach though, and it rarely gets that cold where we live. It might be frustrating if we lived in an area that gets a full 3+ months of actual winter.
B006GVZWUK	May daughter bought this for her dad and he just loves it. It give you the access right at yoru fongertips. Perfect for GPS and even speaker phone. Just attaches to wherever youw ant and it sticks perfectly.
B006GVZWUK	I have an awkward dashboard and it has been a challenge finding an iPhone holder for my car. This one works perfectly and looks sharp with my white iPhone. It also swivels, which has turned out to be really useful. I highly recommend it!
B006GVZWUK	It works perfectly with my iPhone 5 and adjusts for usage with other gadgets!! I would recommend this item to my friends!
B006GVZWUK	When you see a device that has a lever for vacuum suction mount, you naturally assume that that is the primary way in which it adheres to the dash (or windshield).Not this device.First off, it comes with a protective plastic film covering the rubber base that is supposed to hold the vacuum.  When you peel it off, surprise - the rubber base is sticky!  Once you stick it to the dash, you cannot peel it off without losing the "sticky" functionality.  The vacuum lever has a very limited range of motion and I seriously doubt it will be able to hold a smartphone on its own. One star off for that.Luckily I had a disc already mounted on my dash for my GPS' vacuum base and decided to re-purpose it as a permanent place to hold this mount.  Practically no dash these days has a perfectly flat and smooth surface.  Another star off for not providing a mounting disc.I bought this primarily to hold my Samsung Galaxy SII as a GPS and to have the road in full view if I wanted to pickup a call. It does that part ok so far and is able to hold the weight of the phone (do plan properly for clearances in your phone's mounted position BEFORE you stick it).  Whether the glue will last is a different question.  Stay tuned...Update:A month and a half later, this thing is still firmly glued in place, and so far at least, appears reliable enough to hold my phone firmly mounted with the spring mechanism.  Satisfied (but not delighted).
B006GVZWUK	Fits many types of phones, the grip is easy to use for every day in and out of the car. The color matches the phone its being used with. sturdy construction, easy to use. love it.
B006GVZWUK	This mount works great for my Galaxy Nexus.  Like a previous reviewer, I noticed the sticky ring, but I'm not too worried about that.  The mount stays firmly in place, articulates well, and has a solid feel to it.  The only thing I'm a little skeptical about is the way the clasp works.  It's spring loaded so that could be a problem with wear and tear down the road and makes the phone a little difficult to remove.
B006GVZWUK	i have it stuck in the console area and its held up great. holds my phone securely and hasnt fallen off yet. wish i bought the black one though
B006GVZWUK	Awesome for using navigation on iphone!!!! (Ii is adjustable so I am sure it would fit other phones too) YAY!
B006GVZWUK	I love this dash mount.  Fits any phone (unless you still sport a nokia).  I got in a bad car accident and totaled my car.  Airbags came out and all and this little guy still had my phone nice an tight in it's arms.  A great buy and awesome for GPS on your phone.
B006GVZWUK	Overall, I would say that the product is sturdy and well designed - it almost worked. It holds my cell phone (an iPhone 4s) very securely. I also like that I can rotate my phone, while it is in the mount BUT the adhesive ring which holds the base to the dashboard or windshield keeps coming undone causing the mount and phone to just fall down onto the floor on my car. I think the adhesive part of the product needs to be larger, that way the weight of the cell phone won't topple the mount.*****UPDATE*****03/06/2012*****It works well on the windshield.I reattached the the mount to my windshield and it seems to be holding up just fine! It has been attached for over 3 weeks and hasn't fallen. I had originally hoped to attach it to my dashboard, but it didn't seem to hold there.
B006GVZWUK	Hey how long has it taken humanity to finally figure out how to make an attractive functional dashboard holder for you smart phone?  Here it is - works great, looks great, and I have had this thing about a year and its as good today as it was when I first bought it.  Great value, - a must buy
B006GVZWUK	excellent product, immediate processing. received product within 3 days of ordering online. sticks well to car and fits my phone with the case.
B006GVZWUK	I like it on my scion Xbox polar white. It holds my galaxy nexus well... No complaints whatsoever. And I also like its portability.
B006GVZWUK	I have a samsung gallaxy s2 with a ballistic case and this works great most holders wont work with the case on it
B006GVZWUK	First, the sticky base that another reviewer referred to.Second, the spring-loaded keeper that grips the phone in place broke - the springs inside the sealed unit broke away from wherever they needed to attach to in order to keep the arms tightly gripping the phone in place.JUNK.
B006GVZWUK	I am very happy with my purchase.  I had been looking for something that would house my cell phone in my RX350.  The gear shift was not accommodating for any product and this was perfect.  I would recommend this item to anyone.  It is perfect and I would buy from this seller again!
B006GVZWUK	I purchased this item and another a little different.  This is perfect!  It holds the phone tight.  It is small and not bulky like the other one I bought.  That one went in my 20 year old pick up!  This one is in my 2013 Odysse!  It's small enough to fit almost anywhere and holds its grip!  LOVE IT!
B006GVZWUK	The suction cup works very well. I've been using it for months, the cup never falls down. I like the white color in my car too, that looks elegant.
B006TSZKWK	Having blonde ones is pretty essential and online here was the only place I could find this light a color! all of the variety is fabulous and I recommend having the selection at your disposal!
B006TSZKWK	these are very difficult to useI probably won't use themthey will not stay in my hairthank you
B006TSZKWK	I think if you have a very thick hair you can use these items and cover them completely. But they're not really meant for an active day. They simply sit on your head and you take some of your hair in front of them and cover up the bumpit but it needs to be secured better. I also found I could not get them to create a realistic smooth line.I would only recommend these to people with very thick hair and well secured hairdos.
B006TSZKWK	Although these would do what they're advertised to do when used in thin hair, they would definitely perform better in thicker hair. If you have thinner hair, you'll need to use more hair to cover the Bumpit. Ehen with thicker hair, the little bumps on the Bumpit show through my hair and after an hour, the Bumpit seems to slide down out of place. The item does what it says, but you'll need to make adjustments for it to stay in place for a longer period of time.
B006TSZKWK	I like this product. It works if you have enough hair and patience to do it, It worked pretty well and looked cute.
B006TSZKWK	I like the look of the heightened teased look, but I don't have a lot of hair, and it is very fine.  I did get them to work and it looks great. I wear it often
B006TSZKWK	does what they say. easy to use! dos not hard your head you don't even really feel it! used it at my wedding and it looked great! for sure a worth having in your hair supply
