B003U2M1SE	The clear case is nice.  I am not a fan of cases because I personally feel they make a slim/sleek phone bulky.  However, that was not the case here.  I like the fact that it is a semi-soft rubber.  I have dropped my iPhone a few times and it was perfectly protected.  The case is easy to slip on or off if desired.  I also like that it is clear because I put one of my business cards in the back so my contact info are handy it (in case I leave it on a table at a restaurant by accident which I have done before).
B003U2M1SE	Ordered green and clear.  Green as pictured. Clear has a diamond pattern on back and a thicker edge. The biggest issue with the clear case is that the upper right edge has a big bump with two holes. No reason for it to be there and it makes the thing harder to fit in a tight holster. I shaved it off with an exacto knife but you can see where I sliced it off.  It leaves cutouts for the buttons. The metal buttons sit flush with the edge of the case but they seem functional.  Material is perfect for a bumper.  Harder and tougher than silicone but soft enough to be comfortable. Tolerances are good on cutouts. Silent switch is a little tough and needs a fingernail. Overall I think it was worth the money. Knocked off a star due to item not matching description.
B004I94B2M	The case fits snuggly and is very bright. I am always able to find my phone no matter where I drop it.
B004I94B2M	This case is perfect for my Bravo. It's easy to get on the phone, fits snugly, and feels like it really protects the phone. The openings for the charger, SD card, etc align perfectly. It smelled a little funny the first few days, but that eventually went away.Overall, it's a great case. My favorite thing, besides how well it seems like it'll protect my phone, is that it's inexpensive. You could buy a few in different colors and switch them up whenever you want!Highly recommended product.
B004I94B2M	Got them for a great price and they work perfectly. I like that I have two different cases to match to what colors I wear everyday.
B004I94B2M	I love this product!  Looks and performs as expected!  I recieved it in a timely manner and am very satisfied with my purchase!  I will definitely order from this seller in the future!  Thanks!!!  A++!!!
B004I94B2M	Good Fit, durable.  Bright orange color.  The silicone makes it easy to remove, but it doesn't come off on it's own. My only complaint is that it although it doesn't slip out of your hands, it doesn't slide in and out of tight pockets easily.
B005AMKCXS	this case has saved my phone from many of falls and drops. the phone itself still looks new because of it.
B005AMKCXS	got for wrong phone.. but its very pretty.... so if your looking for pretty colors then this is for you.. I love cheap
B005AMKCXS	Very cheap product. Bought this for my daughter. After a few months, the front cracked and fell off. Then a couple months later, the back cracked. We're waiting for that to fall off now. What a waste of money.
B005NDHC7I	wifey was happy so im happy. i got it at a good price and its her favorite color. so i will be ordering more.
B005QEP3IE	I bought this for my girl and didn't care for it, its too soft and gummy , it doesn't hold its own shape, it fits perfectly shipping was fast, just didn't care for the actual item.
B006BUVNFE	I give this product four stars because it is very thin and still makes you're phone feel light. I will say though, I'm not sure if this case will protect you're phone too much.
B006ZATNRK	Thy sent me the complete wrong one and when I tried to fix it they never emailed me back.  And the case they sent me was cheap looking and tore very easily.
B006ZATNRK	The delivery time of the phone was accurate, but the color was very off.  It shows a light blue in the picture and it is really so blue it is almost a violet/purple.  The case was rubberized part of the case doesn't stay on all that well, but hey...you get what you pay for.  I am not very happy with the case, but that doesn't mean someone else wont be.  It is worth the price I guess, I must of just had my standards set too high.
B006ZATNRK	The case is awesome ! Super cute & protects the phone ! The case got to me quickly too! Overall awesome product :)
B006ZATNRK	I love this case! I got it for protection and it does exactly that! It's also cute which is hard to find!
B007HY4MN8	it is ok but the back holder is too cheap&#34; (fragile) I thought it is a clip but is not
B007HY4MN8	Its great. I love the feature of being able to stand both vertical and horazontal. My phone is procted from accidental drops. I will reccomed you to my friends.
B007HY4MN8	Good product, fit phone would buy more if if I ever need another, as listed. A+++ this was cheap in cost but a good product.
B007HY4MN8	This review I should have done last Summer.But I really liked this phone case. I really loved the kick stand also.  The kick stand thingy kept coming off but nothing that couldn't be fixed or take away from the fact that I loved it. I really order from this seller again in the future. Fast shipping and great price. I gave it four stars because of the kick stand thingy kept coming off. Other than that it was great. Will order again from this seller.
B007HY4MN8	If I had known what a hybrid case meant I would not have deliberated as long as I did before finally buying. I was expecting to receive just a snap on type case with thicker rubber around it. Instead I got a hard snap on case and also a thick rubber or gel type skin that went around the whole case and phone. This prevents the issue that I have run into with every other hard snap on case, which is the thin front plate breaking on one of the sides. I will warn that the kick stand is REALLY hard to open. I mean I have to pry it with something, but I didn't buy it for that part, it's meant to keep my phone safe and it will. I'm so happy with this I have already placed an order for my roommates new HTC One V. (I've attached pictures that show both the case and the skin)
B007HY4MN8	I love this case. The purple is very pretty. It protects my phone very well. I love the kickstand. I dont like the hole plugs.
B007HY4MN8	I got this expecting to fight with the thickness and it not to be something functional. I'm very clumsy and drop my phone often, this case is no thicker than some other cases and it has been a saviour to my phone! I plan to get the other colours :)It arrived sooner than expected and was everything they said it was, i am very satisfied with my purchase!
B007HY4MN8	does not fit the fone it staes on the review have too much play it is much bigger then it claims to be
B007HY4MN8	I got this cover for my niece hoping that it would be a lower-cost alternative to the cover that Cricket offered at the store ($25). The fit is good and it seems to be doing its job well.  The only reason why I did not give it a 5 is that it has a cheap look to it.  I guess that's because it was cheap; however, judging by its performance thus far, it is actually a good product.
B007HY4MN8	The case is too small and doesn't fit my Huawei Mercury like the description said it would, I was sent the case for an Assend Y/M866 and not the Mercury M886. It looks like the one in the photo though.
B007HY4MN8	This phone case is just as good as an otter box in my opinion. Love it and have referred all of my friends
B007HY4MN8	I bought this for my sister and she loved it. I dropped it and it just bounced right off the floor. the case was still attached and she it's shatter proof even on concrete. My niece will tell you herself if she could.
B007HY4MN8	My case is still hanging in there! I bought this case originally from the store for thirty dollars and accidentally threw it away. This is the EXACT same case for sooo much less. I've dropped my phone so many times, and this case prevented so many broken screens mishaps.
B007HY4MN8	For such a cheap price, I was expecting a piece out crap BUT this case is Amazing. Something I easily would have paid $20 at the store for and only 9 cents online. Just what I've been looking for!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!! Not to mention it came really fast!!!!
