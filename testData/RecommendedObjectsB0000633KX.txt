B001IUU0IS	The description is in error in TWO ways.One, the description states:"Combines with any travel or data cable charger to charge and/or sync with a BlackBerry smartphone"This is not true.  All you get is the pod shown.  It connects to a charging adapter/cable to simplycharge your phone.  Yes, your phone will stand up and look nice.  Yes, it will charge.  Yes, it isbetter than plugging in the cable each time.  But you CAN'T hook it to a laptop, PC, etc.  The includedmanual states this.  There is no data transfer.Two, the description states:"LED 2-colour indicators identify whether smartphone is charging or charged"First of all, it's not "colour" as we don't live in Britain.  It's "COLOR."Second, Not even close.  The logo on the front does NOT light up under anycircumstance.  There is a SMALL LED Light behind the phone, that you can't seewhen the phone is docked in the pod.  It lights "white" to show there is powerto the pod.  It does not change color ever.  It does not care if the phone isdocked, not docked, charging, or charged - it is always white if it has power.Amazon needs to update the description in both areas.I have returned this item at Amazon's expense as the item was not as described.-Dave
B001IUU0IS	ok it beats having to plug the phone into the charger with that tiny micro port on the side... phone works as a great bed side clock
B001IUU0IS	The product description states: Combines with any travel or data cable charger to charge and/or sync with your smartphoneHowever, when I received the item the pictogram instructions that came with it specifically said not to use a data cable with the charging pod.  Also the pearl flip doesn't seat securely in the pod.
B001IUU0IS	I purchased this so that I can sync and charge my Blackberry flip phone. When my phone is plugged into my computer using just the USB cable (not included with the pod) my device is recognized on my computer and I can sync and charge. However when I hook up the USB cable to the pod my blackberry will only charge and does not show up on my computer. I have tried changing cables and manually adding the drive but neither has worked. So at best, this is a glorified phone charger and with the cost of shipping it is not worth it to send it back.
B00317Y4QK	The Product Description for his charger shows:Charging time:1. Charging the device only:a) Charged by USB cable (connected to computer): 3.5 hoursb) Charged by AC charger (5v1A): 3 hours2. Charging the 2nd battery only:a) Charged by AC charger (5v1A): 3.5 hours3. Charging the device and 2nd battery at the same time:b) Charged by AC charger (5v1A): 3.5 to 4 hoursCharging results may vary for different phone models.First, the disclaimer at the end (which, just as the specs, is simply copied from the manufacturer's web site) does not make any sense since the charger is labeled specifically for the HTC Tilt 2 (GSM) Only For AT&T; phone.Regarding the charging times, the manufacturer's website shows the same charging times as above. However they are shown nowhere on the packaging.I tested this charger over for 2 nights:Night 1: I started with my phone having a battery capacity left of 90%. After 5 hours on charge the battery charge indicator on the phone was still amber. When I checked the phone it showed 100% battery capacity. Note that the HTC charger that was included with the phone would have taken under one hour to fully charge the battery to the point where the battery charge indicator would turn green.Night 2: I started with my phone having a battery capacity left of 70%. After almost 7 hours on charge the battery charge indicator on the phone was still amber. When I checked the phone it showed 90% battery capacity. Note that the HTC charger that was included with the phone would have taken under one and a half hour to fully charge the battery to the point where the battery charge indicator would turn green.Night 3: I started with my phone having a battery capacity left of 60%. After almost 7 hours on charge the battery charge indicator on the phone was still amber. When I checked the phone it showed 80% battery capacity. Note that the HTC charger that was included with the phone would have taken under one and a half hour to fully charge the battery to the point where the battery charge indicator would turn green.Since the AC adapter that this charger uses does not have a mini-USB connector I could not test the adapter without going thru the cradle. However, another charger that I tested and looked identical to this had the mini-USB connector. With that charger, when I did not go thru the cradle the charging times were about the same as the OEM charger. So there is something in the cradle that appears to limit the charging.A simple search on Amazon will bring up several other chargers that look the same but have different brands. Apparently there is a common manufacturer. So far I tested 3 of these chargers, all with the same result.Now it is time to deal with a return.
B00420Z1OO	The charger was exactly what I needed and works perfectly.  No complaints!  The process was quick and easy.  I received the charger quickly!
B00420Z1OO	At first I thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. But after less than two months BOTH of them no longer work. Cheap junk. Buy USA!!
B00420Z1OO	I bought this for my daughter because I've bought stuff through Amazon in the past and have always been happy. This charger literally stopped working only a month after it was purchased! She tried to get in touch with the actual place it came from and she got NO RESPONSE!! she again, and again, and still no response. So she just got so fed up and let it go. Only problem was, it was my money that was spent on this crap. No, it wasn't much but just the fact that we bought something with the expectations that it was going to work and work well for a while and something be done if it didn't, and it turned out totally different was very frustrating. So here it is, a couple years later, that stupid charger was thrown in the trash, I'm out the money and basically GAVE it to someone whom I don't even know for a little plastic box that they said would do a job and they don't even have the GOKNADS to contact their customers when one of their products goes belly up!!
B00420Z1OO	I purchased this because my wifes ports on her cell phones keep continuing to get damaged, so now she can have her battery charged for her phone at all times, I recommend having two batteries though that way your never out of commision. Good buy works excellent!
B00420Z1OO	I loveeeeee it. Best thing that I ever bought for my cell phone on amazon. I can charge all my batteries in least then 24hrs.
B00480V28C	it was a good prodict, but it did not work for my phone so i had to send it back, make one for samsung s3 !!!!
B00480V28C	Pros - it fits the captivate well, charges the phone, and the desktop app is functional, defaulting to a clock.  If you use your alarm, it turns the captivate into a nice bedside alarm clock.Cons- very few options.  NO DATA SYNC WITH USB.  ALWAYS defaults to Home Dock App  - unable to default to car home app (this dock would have worked perfectly in my car with velcro if the app wasn't such a pita to setup by the time you exit the home dock app.)
B00480V28C	This Desktop Docking Station is the original OEM Samsung model.  I have seen a lot of cheap knock-offs that look almost identical but when you try to use them, they perform poorly or do not work at all.  Not the case with this one.  This is exactly what's pictured/described.  It arrived in the original Samsung packaging.If you're looking for a great Desktop Dock for your Captivate - This is IT!  This is the real thing, not a cheap junk imposter trying to charge near-OEM prices.  It costs less than directly from Samsung, and it's REAL!
B00480V28C	This charging station does not fit the t-mobile galaxy S. The usb connect is in the wrong place.  All I got out of this was a wall charger. Be careful to check that the docking station will fit your galaxyS. They are not all the same.
B00480V28C	Super easy to use and looks great. The price is right for this product. No &#34;cons&#34;...only pros. I like the fact that it doesn't take up a lot of space. Sturdy and doesn't tip over.
B00480V28C	Although the dock works the way that it should, it doesn't work with my phone. It is made for an At&t version of the phone, not the t-mobile version. therefore, the phone doesn't sit properly on the dock. The seller should list that it is an At&t dock....
B00480V28C	the dock stopped working after a couple months, poor for a samsung branded product. it was great while it lasted.
B00480V28C	I wanted this for my Sansung Galaxy X, which they said it was for, but it does not fit. It can be plugged in but it hangs off of the plug, without support it will disconnect. I had to tape something under it to keep it straight in the holder. I don't know if I should return it and find one that fits just the Galaxy X. Like I said, it's ok, but I wish I would have double checked with the seller first.
B00480V28C	I got this item the other day and so far I definitely like it. The one issue that I've had is that when I try to dock it the volume up button sometimes turns the volume on by itself when I need it on vibrate. Other than that, I use it at work for a charger and it looks better than a line hanging out of my computer to a phone that's just sitting there on the desk.When I dock it asks if I want to go to Desk Home or to Lightning Bug (awesome free app that's like a sounds machine) but I'm fine with that. Like I said, overall I'm very happy with this item so far.
B00480V28C	Wouldn't play sound out of the auxiliary port, limiting it to simply a charger. No hdmi port. The phone doesn't have one, but that doesn't mean the dock can't.
B00480V28C	I bought this dock specifically for the audio output on the back, only to find that it doesn't work!  I read several reviews that said the output would work with 2.2, but that's not the case for me.  Since I really don't need the desktop functions, I must give this a low rating, and I am tempted to return it.
B00480V28C	Way too much static in the line out (so much that it's basically pointless having the feature).  Also, the stand doesn't integrate well with the phone - one must disable the speaker in the "Desk Home" app (AND, in some cases turn the media volume off to get the phone to actually shut up - so that only the line-out on the back of the stand is producing static...err, I mean sound).  Intuitive, huh?Overall quite disappointed...so much the product ought to be pulled until the kinks have been worked out.But to be fair, not all is bad.  On a positive note, it does charge the phone decently well...I suppose it could be a fairly decent solution for a night stand/alarm clock arrangement.  Aside from that, I've found the stand to be largely useless...
B00480V28C	Man, I was hoping this would have been a great product as the phone is awesome.  The first one I returned as the USB connection broke the moment I plugged in the cable?!?  RMA'd and got new one.  This one still has cable plugged in but there is so much static when I plug a speaker/headphone into the jack it is unusable.  This only happens when the charging cable is plugged into the wall, massive power bleed in the circuitry NOT COOL.Otherwise it works great, it keeps my phone from getting knocked around on my desk ,holds it @ a great angle to see the screen, and doesn't take up room.
B00480V28C	Love this desktop dock.  Get back to my dorm from classes all day and what no better way than to put my phone on the dock and listen to music, also a good alarm clock.
B00480V28C	This is my second dock.  I have one for work and the other on my night stand.  Turns my most useful device (my phone) into a reliable alarm clock.  Would recommend to anyone.  Only issue is the I have not bee able to get the speaker output in the back to work.
B00480V28C	This is a great product.  The only problem is that you cannot have a case on the phone to use it.
B00480V28C	My wife wanted a dock for her Samsung phone.  It works just like it's supposed to.  It holds her phone securely on the counter and charges it in the process. Simple but functional. Good product.
B00480V28C	It does the job, but it is not as stable as I expect it to be.  Phone can slide off the stand easily.  Also, when placing the phone on stand volume keys can hit the bottom of the stand and change the valume settings.
B00480V28C	I found the docking station OK - easy to slide phone in/out of.  Since you need to charge everyday - that is handy.  But as other folks have said - the SW tools are in need of refinement.  Plus you can not connect a USB data cable from the dock to your PC.  So it really is just for charging.Lastly - I agree with all the other posts you read in the review - these are accurate and you can certainly see a theme emerging.  Take note if this is not for you.
B00480V28C	Simply elegant design and function with a sensible price makes this dock a great deal. I have been using it for months without any issues.
B00480V28C	So I got this Desktop dock for Christmas, as a gift, and for the most part it does what it is designed to do.  Here is a quick run-down of how I feel about it.Pros:Very sturdyCompact and pleasant on the eye on a tableCons:Came adhered to the packaging that left a stick residue on the dockThe only thing that really keeps the phone in place is the USB connector (would have been great if there was a small lip that ran across the front, that way if you happen to move the phone it wouldn't push strain on the USB connector)The audio output does NOT work even with running FroyoI'm glad I got this as a gift and didn't pay for it.  If I had to pay for it I would have only been willing to spend 10$ at most for it (that is including tax and S&H;).
B00480V28C	The cradle I received does not charge my phone.  I have tried the included cord and off brand.  The cord plug is snug and firm when inserted directly into the phone, so I am blaming the male plug in the cradle.  The design of the Samsund with the USB Port on the top is dumb.  The volume rocker is activated by the slightest pressure on the end of the phone in the cradle as well.  I have not even bothered to chech the audio connetion. I am assuming with the micro usb not making connection for power it is not going to pass audio.
B00480V28C	Bought it for bed side use with Galaxy S3, but plug does not match up with phone. Not a bad charger for the right phone.
B00480V28C	Pro:* Works great* Inexpensive (available on-line for less than $25)* I love the Desk Home app (works even better on Android 2.2)Con:* Still cannot "sync" while sitting in the dock
B00480V28C	I bought this product thinking that it will fit my Galaxy 4 as well, as it is shown on the picture.Also, I tought that I can plug in my cell phone without using two hands. I cant use this dock with only one hand as it is very light. Any way I need two hand to charge the phone and i can do this with the normal cabel and it will be free.Nice idea, bad realization.
B005GVVKH0	Most stands I've found don't work well with cases - the USB microconnector is recessed enough that a phone with case won't connect.  On other stands the issue is that the slot in the base of the stand is too small for the phone to fit into if the case is on the phone.  This stand doesn't have that problem. The only complaint I have is that the base is a little narrow.  It seems stable enough but I would rather it a bit wider and thus more stable.I'd also like a version that could handle the phone in landscape position.
B005GVVKH0	Amazon sent this item in two days! Thanks Amazon. The stand works but only with a phone that doesn't have a case. If you use any kind of protective case don't buy this item because it just will not work! Looks neat in the seat though.
B005GVVKH0	I use this product every single day.  It holds it just right for my viewing of Netflix at my desk.
B005GVVKH0	Honestly, I purchased two of these wondering if they looked better than they functioned and after receiving them and setting them up I found that they are just as functional as they are stylish!The dock is a simple yet elegant design that holds the phone at about a 65-70 degree angle which is perfect for viewing. The cable included, although only a USB cable and not a DC cable is still very nice, durable and will connect to any DC-USB plug. I picked up a few locally for quite cheap and plugged them in. The base is sturdy and the connection to the phone is snug but the phone does wobble a tad when the base is used. Considering this is a charging and docking base I don't see this as a major problem. My own phone sits nicely without any case or skin and my wife's phone which has a snap-on cover still fits well without any issue whatsoever. Another great feature of this affordable dock is that you can sit your phone on it in landscape mode since it offers extra room in front of the micro-usb connection for the phone.One of the huge benefits over other units is that this one is more "universal" in design meaning you can turn the micro-usb connection around should you need to use it for a phone that has a port facing the opposite direction.Pros:StylishSturdyStableSamsung Galaxy SII can fit with or without a case attachedPhone sits nicely in portrait or landscape without any issueSince the charge/dock unit uses a micro-usb you can pretty much use it with any other phone, not just a Samsung i9100 so this unit will come in handy when you upgrade to a new phone!Cons:Only comes with a USB cable and not a DC cable (this is specified in the description but just wanted to mention it)The connection between the cable and the stand itself is a bit wobbly but not a deal breaker by any means
B005GVVKH0	I love the simplicity of thos dock. It is really beautiful in its minimalism. It fits the electronic perfectly, even with the media player's silicone case. Two thingsvthat would make a really great product even better: 1) a wider base to make it more stable in its top heavy state; 2) a way to plug in to a bottom headphone jack while mounted to the dock. Even without those improvements I LOVE this device, and even though this is about the product here and not the seller, I have to just say that when I contacted them about replacing the cord, they were so polite and helpful. I got the replacement cord FAST. I would absolutely do business with this seller again. I wish all Amazon sellers were this great to work with!
B005GVVKH0	I loved this charger when i first received it, would charge everything, my kindle and phone. Now i have hard time getting it to charge my phone period wont even bother trying the kindle anymore. my phone seems to get hot after being on there, which it did not do in the beginning. Very disappointed
B005GVVKH0	This looks terrific, nice and sleak and charges great! The less than over the top price makes this perfect and I would suggest this to anyone looking for a nicely designed and functional docking charger.
B005GVVKH0	I love the elegance of the design, it's also very useful because at the time you charge you can interact with it. I also use even when it is not charging because it hold so good and convenient. I highly recommend.
B005GVVKH0	This is a great idea.  I was going to use this as my alarm clock, but when I try to reach for it to try and mute the alarm I knock it off the stand and usually behind the night stand.  Very frustrating.
B005GVVKH0	My big issue with this product is the speed in which it charges.  It charges probably 3-4x slower than my other usb charging cables.  Obviously a cheap cable.The phone sits higher in the cradle than I was imagining, and the phone basically balances on the plug.  Nothing to support it in the front or bottom.I guess I would use it to sync to my comp but I would never use it to charge.  If the cable is that bad it's probably not good to be charging your battery with it anyways, although I don't know anything about whether a battery is affected by crappy charging cables.
B005GVVKH0	- Cheap, flimsy plastic.- Cord is laughably short.- So wobbly as to be unusable.The whole point of a stand is that it causes the phone to stand up while you use it.  Will be returning this.
B005GVVKH0	Once again, the makers and designers of cell phone cradles and accessories don't know that 80 percent of phones are in a case...ya, I am just pulling that number out of my..But seriously, they should extend the micro usb tip 2 mm.Otherwise it is pretty cool and I imagine without a case it works well.
B005GVVKH0	My Galaxy s4 is in a slim case, however the design of the stand and its micro USB does not allow for ANY CASE.
B005GVVKH0	Beautiful, unexpensive, works fine. If you are like me and use both Android you will like to know it work as fine with Apple phones (just replace the cable)
B005GVVKH0	I love the simplicity of the design. It allows me to just charge my phone and keep it out of the middle of my desk. It also makes syncing documents and music from my laptop to my phone a breeze.
B005GVVKH0	Works as expected. I have a Blackberry and this is great as a bedside clock holder/charger. It looks good, too.
B005GVVKH0	I like the design of the dock, and went from another kind of dock to this one because on the other, the phone was hanging from its port and not actually lying on the back of the dock and..... SAME THING, on this one my S2 and now S3 don't touch the back of the dock so it hangs only from its port, I had to adapt a transparent piece of plastic (to keep aesthetics) on the back of it so my phone can rest on the back and not on the port.
B005GVVKH0	my phone is not recognized using the poor quality USB cable, I always get 'USB Device Not Recognized.'  I left the original USB cable at a hotel, it's long gone.  The only cable that I have found to have my computer to recognize it is the cheap retractable cable that I bought from Amazon unlike this expensive POC.  It's also a little wobbly on my desk.  This is not a solid build.If you want it for a SGSII Skyrocket, don't, it will not sync with your computer.
B005GVVKH0	This is a neat looking little (and I emphasize this word- it is tiny)docking station. However, I new as soon as I picked it up that it would not last. Here is why:You are supplied with only a USB cable for charging/ docking. I have a USB wall adapter, so this was no problem for me. In order to set the thing up, you have to unhook (unclick) a tiny plastic dock, slip the USB in, lock it back and dock your phone. Sounds easy? No. It is not. Mine broke after 15 seconds of trying to "unlock it" and I was gentle and was not exerting a whole lot of pressure. Still got it to work, though.This is worth, in US dollars, about $5. Don't waste your time.
B005GVVKH0	The support feet on the bottom could spread more apart to provide additional stability.  Also the micro-usb connector could be more secure.
B005GVVKH0	I bought this dock to use with non-Samsung phones.  The great thing about it is that the connector is reversible.  I bought three of these.  My wife's HTC One fits it fine.  however with the Nexus 5 I had to put a little bit of padding where the back of the phone rests to support the phone.
B005GVVKH0	If you use these docks, you are stuck using the cables that came with them which are specific to the dock.  That means you can't put in longer cables if you need to.  It works well if you can live with the short cable and it looks stylish.  But the lack of cable change-out was a dealbreaker for me so I returned this.
B005GVVKH0	I think this is a great device.  I was not expecting to have to insert the cord (provided) into the stand but other than that it serves its purpose.
B005GVVKH0	Works awesome!  I love it!  It is easy to use and it's sleek and stylish.  I use it constantly . I had to modify my d30 case but it was ok,  I love it anyway.
B005GVVKH0	You need to be really careful about using your phone when it's docked, because it falls backwards very easily.  This is especially bad when you keep you dock at the edge of your desk, where it will just roll right off the desk, taking your precious phone with it.  The connection is very delicate as well.  It's easy for your phone to rock side-to-side while it's docked, losing your connection with your PC.It doesn't work with my Galaxy S4 is landscape either (unless I take the slim case off, and then it just barely stays in place).It's not horrible, but it's definitely not great.  Its only saving grace is how cool it looks.  I'll definitely buy something else next time.
B005GVVKH0	This charger works great, and the phone looks good in it. No problems. It's better than just laying the phone down somewhere.
B005GVVKH0	I bought two of these and the first one worked like a charm and I instantly fell in love with it! I bought a second for my office but was very disappointed when I came to diagnose the cord was deffective. Not wanting to go through the frustration of having to send the cord back and wait even longer I thought about just eating the loss on the second cord. I decided to email the company and explain the situation. They quickly resolved the problem and in less that 24 hours, they shipped me a new cord without me having to go through the frustration of sending the defective one back. If more companies functioned like this one, we would never hear those horrid stories from fellow users about online purchases! My hats off to this product and this company!
B005GVVKH0	It looks nice and it is non Samsung Galaxy III specific, but it is a bit of a cheap plastic in which they did not bother to even connect the cable (not too difficult to do, but still...). The major problem is that it is unstable and the phone falls easily. For the same reason it becomes a two-hands affair to put the phone back (you need to hold the base with one hand, the phone with the ohter). Same goes for using the phone for browsing when on the cradle. Unless you are extremely careful (and I mean extremely delicate) the cradle and the phone will fall.
B005GVVKH0	I've been looking for a universal charging dock for my LG Rumor.  The dock looks good, was easy to setup (instructions with illustrations on back of the box),  and it works.  Didn't give 5 stars because I feel that it's overpriced.
B005GVVKH0	Similar to others, I wish it was heavier and a little sturdier, but the versatility of the thing makes it worth it.
B005GVVKH0	Dont even try S4 will not fit with or without case falls over not very sturdy but i keep mine as it will do as a charger
B005GVVKH0	It's a ok dock, does work with Tasker to adjust the settings based on being stood upright, not sure about Screeble. Now my main issues with it are 2 things.One it's rather flimsy and it's hard to adjust anything on the device (like forwarding to the next song) without using to hands, or risking knocking it over.Two I can't use my great case with it. This causes me to constantly take the case on and off, and might put me in a position to damage my phone because I will go caseless more than I normally would.Three the cord is rather long, and should have more than a "slot" to pass through, takes away a lot from the sleek look of the dock.Besides that it's a good dock. Just be wary if you think it works with all cases, because I bought one of the best cases for my phone, and now it's worthless with this dock. And sadly this is the only dock that seems to work with my phone (Epic Touch 4g).
B005GVVKH0	This device is very small(space saver) and unique in design.  It did take me about 10 minutes to get the cable inserted.  You have to position it then get it locked into place which is were the &#34;work&#34; comes into play. The directions are not very defined and should be written out in my opinion versus the diagram.  I do wish the cord was longer and the dock would display the clock feature like my previous one did.  I am not able to leave my case on while the phone is charging, but that is fine with me.  I read another review that said the dock should have been less than $20 and I agree.  It doesn't offer enough aside of charging for the cost.
B005GVVKH0	I purchased this for my LG G2, which is about the same size and weight of the Galaxy S4.  The stand is too small and too light.  It stands upright if I don't touch my phone. If I try to look at my notifications, it tips over backwards. Also, charging is an issue. I kept getting notified that the charger is incompatible with my phone, even when using the OEM charger, which I know works with a different cable. I discovered that my 2nd gen iPad charger will work with the Sinjimoru cable and dock, but that makes it very inconvenient to charge my iPad. I even tried plugging directly into my computer and to a powered USB hub and those don't work either.I'm giving this 2 stars because it tips over easy and the description says it works with all center mount micro USB smartphones... which is clearly not the case.  Can't decide if I should return it, or give it to one of my kids for their device.
B005GVVKH0	The shipping was very fast, and the product arrived in perfect condition. The stand itself is great. It's stylish and looks great on your desk. It doesn't wobble, and functions greatly. The setup is tricky and can be a pain, but when you're done, it pays off. It charges correctly, and works great. However, I believe that the price is a little to high for a plastic stand like this. Even so, I still love this product. I highly recommend this.
B005GVVKH0	The pictures on the description make the holder look much bigger than it actually is. It is tiny compared to my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. It is sharp looking but it is not very functional. If you try and operate the phone, you will tip it over. The stand does however charge my phone and it isnt just laying flat on the night stand. The stand does however hold the phone upright and will not topple unless the phone is moved/pushed by touching.
B005GVVKH0	I've purchased two of these now; one for home and one for the office. Really nice quality. Heavy-duty construction and attractive, unique design. There's a very thin rubber strip on the bottom of the back leg which helps it stay put nicely on smooth surfaces, Fits my S4 perfectly.If I could think of another place to use it, I'd buy a third one!
B005GVVKH0	I'm very happy with this Dock. I've been looking for a Dock for my LG Optimus L9 for awhile now. I really like this one because One it fits my phone very well, and two because of the semicircular design it helps to amplify the sound of my phone so I can listen to music or podcasts while the phone sits on the dock. So I'm very happy with this product.
B005GVVKH0	This dock is exactly what I was looking for simple, clean design, and it allows me to dock my Samsung Galaxy S2 (AT&T) with a case on.
B005GVVKH0	Purchased the Sync Stand with the micro USB for use with my Mophie iPhoine 5 case. Device works great and keeps my phone close by and neatly stored at work. Charges battery and phone with issue. Only wish it would sync my phone and computer at the same time.
B005GVVKH0	I tried this with a Galaxy S3 and a Galaxy Note 2 and the PC would not recognize either device.  As such it is simply an over priced charging stand.  Based on some of the other reviews, the cable is cheap and has inconsistent quality. Buyer be ware on this one.
B005GVVKH0	Cheap plastic, doesn't hold the phone tight, can easily tip over. If you are looking for a stand for the galaxy SII, I would keep searching. Would not recommend.
B005GVVKH0	Does not charge. Seller was great about response timing when contacted about issue.  I gave this rating based on the use of the product. Looks great and thought it would be a nice Christmas gift.  Didn't turn out the way I liked.
B005GVVKH0	I read another review that said he anchored it to a tile and then it had a base and was useful.  I am going to anchor mine because it is worthless just sitting on a surface. You can't get anything docked to it because is is so unstable.  If you do pick it up, dock it, put it down on a surface it looks nice. Remember, don't go anywhere near it cause the slightest movement will cause it to tumble over.  This thing is crazy bad.
B005GVVKH0	If you have a case on your phone you can't use this charger. Well unless you enjoy peeling the case off every time you need to charge your phone. Mine is in a desk drawer somewhere, somebody make me an offer.
B005GVVKH0	I had been looking for something to dock my samsung stratosphere.  I like to listen to Pandora while I'm at work.  This is perfect for that purpose.  It keeps my phone charged while keeping my phone upright so I can see the display.  My only complaint is that the angle does not make it easy to actually use the phone while it's docked.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend this product.
B005GVVKH0	I got this as a christmas gift for my SG2, and so far i like it. I use it often to plug into my computer, and either charge it or sync files and etc. Looks simple and elegant.Its not the most stable or strong thing in the world, but you really dont need it to be. The only major complaint is that it doesnt come with a simple wall plug in to just use it as a charging dock.Otherwise i like it so far.
B005GVVKH0	We all use cases with our phones so it's ridiculous that the charging mechanism is too short to charge the phone with a case over it.
B005GVVKH0	I received the Sinjimoru Sync Stand and found the packaging easy to open, with none of the hassels form the sealed plastic. The stand is a little light weight side and I feel it will make it diffcult to dis-mount. Unfortunately I am not going to get to try because it will not work with my Otterbox Defender. It would have been benefical if they listed any cases it would not supprot or provided an extension for the micro USB. Better luck next time Sinjimoru!Sinjimoru Sync Stand Dock Cradle Holder with USB Cable for iPhone 4, 4S, 3G, 3GS, and iPod (BLACK)
B005GVVKH0	I just got this for my T-mobile Samsung Galaxy S2 (T989). Samsungs cradle does not sync the phone. It only charges. That's why I wound up buying this. I have 2 main problems with this cradle. The phone is way too top heavy. So if you were to knock into it (even a little bit), it will topple over. My other problem is the micro connector. There is plenty of space if you use an ordinary phone case. I'm using the D30 (which is a good case, btw). The problem is you have to grab the whole phone and cradle and yank the phone out with two hands lol. Maybe it'll get a bit looser in time. I doubt it though. I'm going to try one last thing and glue this cradle down to a heavy object. I actually saw a review where a guy grabbed a brick and glued it down to it. Hope this helped. Good luck.
B005GVVKH0	I am using this with my Galaxy s4 with Otterbox commuter case.  As it is manufactured, this cradle is no use unless your phone is out of a case.  The opening on the bottom of the case is to deep that the USB jack that is in the front side of the cradle does not connect properly.  So, I remove the plastic cover of the jack (it will split into two) and with a utility knife, I removed the inside edge of the cover that wraps around the usb jack so the jack sits slightly higher (if you can see the top of the black base of the jack for about a 1/16 of an inch, it will do).  With this tinkering, the jack sticks out long enough to properly connect to my phone.  You do not need to glue the case together since the clip that sets this is very tight.  With this method, this cradle works as it is designed.  I tried RND Dock and 2nd Battery Charger for Samsung Galaxy S4 (compatible without or with a slim-fit case) (white), but returned immediately because there seems to be no room for us to mess with RND Dock.  Now I don't have to remove the case to use Sinjimoru cradle.
B005GVVKH0	I like the style of the "dock" (am I the only one that sees this as a charger and stand?)  It has a nice look and it charges my phone.  It's *waaaay* to light weight to dependably hold your phone upright as the slightest nudge will knock it over.  Also, if you try to use the screen at all, your whole setup will wobble hopelessly.  I think the $19 price I paid was a little high too.  Whatever.I'm ordering two more.  I came up with a solution to all my problems:  epoxy and some nice leftover marble tile.I love marble.  I bought some surplus marble tile a while back and I just glue cheap stuff like this to it with epoxy.  Now I can operate my phone on the charger stand with one hand and there's literally 0 risk of it tipping over without a serious whack that would knock it clean off the usb attachment anyway.\o/
B005GVVKH0	It works. It's stylish. The height pushes the center of gravity a little high so it isn't quite as sturdy as I would like, but don't think it's so unstable it will fall over just standing there, nothing like that, but it's made of plastic so I really can't complain about it much. I ordered black but the cable that comes with it is white - it would make more sense if the cable (approximately 3ft) matched the color of the stand. The cable and dock wasn't assembled and it took a mild bit of effort to get it assembled - I was a little concerned about breaking off plastic retention tabs putting it together, but I got it and it's a 1-time process, so I believe it will remain solid. Overall it does what it's supposed to do - hold and charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch. It's good, but the small things mentioned hold it back from being 5-stars of "awesome." I'd still buy it again.
B005GVVKH0	For a desktop stand, the phone looks good when its inserted, but that's about it.  The stand is tiny, light, and not very balanced.  It is very easy to tip over the phone with it in the stand and virtually impossible to insert the phone without picking up the stand and holding it. With a desktop "dock" you're looking for a drop and go / pickup and go experience which this does not deliver.  I cannot recommend this product.  If I hadn't destroyed the packaging getting it open I'd return it.
B005GVVKH0	I use Screebl Pro (App) on my Samsung Epic Touch (Galaxy SII) - and the screen kept turning off (as it is supposed to).  So I wanted a dock for at work so I can keep the phone at an angle that Screebl will say is on -- and make it available as I use iHeartRadio and/or Pandora and/or TuneIn Radio ... or just watch the Inferno Live Wallpaper - to try to beat writer's block.I have not bought a case yet - so I was looking for a dock that would be compatible with the Seidio Innocase after I bought it ...  and this one does.  I have tried the dock with a friend's Epic Touch and Innocase and it fit w/o any issue.Yes - it is light weight ..and I pretty much need to hold it if I want to punch the screen with my finger.  So what.  I was wanting it for visual display -- not for playing games.It is pretty - fits my phone w/o a case and with a case.  In a docking station?  What more do we need?
B005GVVKH0	I had to glue a blank CD to the bottom of this thing so that my S3 did not fall overy time I bumped it. Putting it together was a little bit of a challenge but once I figured out the combination it was no problem. I use this at work to keep my S3 charged. It looks pretty futuristic . Matches well with my phone. No problems so far. I would recommend this product.
B005GVVKH0	The cradle is small and very eligant, however, because of the way the phone mounts in it, it is top heavy and can fall over very easily. Also, the cable to the cradle is very thin, and the typical throughput of electricity for this cable does not always charge the phone. Have tried multiple adapters and this is based on the capability of the cable.
B005GVVKH0	Very cheap material and not worth the price. Not what I had expectedI was very disappointed when I had received the product I was trying to check the package if maybe there was still something in that  package other then this product, i'm thinking maybe they made a mistake not knowing i'm the one that made the mistake.
B005GVVKH0	I like it because it maintain the phone in an upright position or sideways making it easier to view videos.
B005GVVKH0	I have one for a S3 and an iPod. They look cool and you pay for that in the price. Fancy looking on my desk.
B005GVVKH0	Ive had this chaging cradle for quite awhile now and i love it.I can plug it in the wall or my computer depending when and where i am when i need it. I even use it to charge my plantronics blue tooth headset.
B005GVVKH0	Love product wish it could have an regular wallJack as well, looks really nice and I can see who is calling cause it stands upright
B005GVVKH0	Really like the simplicity of this stand.  I use it primarily on my nightstand, and it serves that purpose well.  Small enough to travel well.  Minus one star as it doesn't activate dock mode on a Galaxy Note 3, but that is to be expected
B005GVVKH0	The plug in portion of the stand isn't convenient and if you bump it, it topples over. Not very good.
B005GVVKH0	You get a piece of plastic and almost a regular microUSB cable.Plastic is very light and it cannot be used as some sturdy stand.There is original Samsung dock which offers 3.5mm output so it's probably worth trying over this (~5$ more).
B005GVVKH0	I'm not a big phone user but when I want it I like it to be ready. I just keep it on this dock and when I'm ready so is my phone, perfect.
B005GVVKH0	Kinda small and wobbly with my galaxy s4, but not enough that I don't like it.  I will probably order a few more :)
B005GVVKH0	Cute design,  it is prone to tip over when using the touch screen.  Unable to charge phone while the case is on the phone.  Expensive for what you get.
B005GVVKH0	Great Price and amazing look. Perfect for the office. The cradle works exactly as advertised. I'm a very satisfied customer
B005GVVKH0	This is a really classy looking stand to have on your desk as it charges your smartphone.Universal for Android Smartphones? OF COURSE!Because of the way the Sinjimoru stand is designed, all you need to do is rotate the USB 2.0 plug 180 degrees "BEFORE" you snap the adapter back on.This also works if your smartphone has its charge port on the side as well. However if your chargeport is on top, its gonna look awkward but still usable.(See the third image in the product images and you will understand, the cable can be rotated as it is a rectangle shape which slots into a adapter, which fits into the dock itself)i have this new one next to the First-gen Sinjimore Stand made for Ipod Touch 4G and they look great together.I got lucky with my purchase and they included the Black USB 2.0 cable and not the White one. &lt;3Before this purchase i was looking online frantically for a charging stand since i bought the iNEW i4000 5" Android smartphone. And was depressed at all the ugly bulky designs made for generic smartphones. UNTIL I saw this!One thing to note is to not POKE your device at the top when it is charging. Because of the design, its will tip and topple the stand backwards. This may be different if you choose to but the FULL ALUMINUM version. This one is Black plastic.Because they did not carry any Black Aluminum versions I didn't buy the Silver Aluminum ones.In the future i plan on gluing something heavy at the bottom of the stand. This way it won't topple as easily. The design gives a lot of generous space for additional weight.I love it! and highly recommend this to others as a classy way to mount/charge/sync your Android Smartphone!
B005HURUBK	The price is a little high BUT you get 2 batteries with it ,everything works well, good product. It arrived fast and packed well.
B005HURUBK	Cradle, charger, and batteries all work very well. The strap is useless as there is no place for strap on the phone or the skin covering the case.
B005HURUBK	Its a good buy for 2 extra batteries, Battery will not last long looks like thesame as the original witth 152oMah this battery was advertised as 19oo. Will only last 4 to 6 hours with minimal use, its good buy at least you have two spare ones, the cradle will not hold the phone with cover on it the strap is useless. Bottom line average battery and it is pricy.
