B00024SKOW	Comfortable and sound/mic good, but "Accessory not supported" message on NOKIA 6350 phone! If you have Nokia 6350 get only HS-9 !!!
B00024SKOW	This is the best hands free cell phone headset I've found for older phones that are not Blue Tooth compatable.  It fits either ear, is comfortable to wear, has excellent sound quality and makes using a cell phone while driving MUCH SAFER.  It also makes hearing a caller much easier in crowded or noisy situations. Fits Nokia cell phones.
B00024SKOW	I prefer over the head units but they tend to break overtime because they have more parts. This boom headset will probably not break as easy but it is not as comfortable but it serves the purpose for why I bought it. It simple and reliable.
B00024SKOW	This is the best design for the handsfree cell phone use.  Those in the ear tunnel designs begin to be painful within an hour or so.  Buyer needs to be sure of the correct connector for their cell phone.  Initially, I purchase this design from a Verizon store that new it would work.  After I returned it and discovered the proper connector design, I purchased it from this supplier at a good savings.
B00024SKOW	It's a cheap little thing and acts like a cheap little thing.  Hard plastic makes it uncomfortable in your ear after a little while.  I keep forgetting there's an answer/hangup button on it, so I keep ending calls - but I'll get used to that.  At first, it had lots of static from where the headset meets the phone, but that has seemed to magically disappeared.It's good for the price, just too bad Amazon uses the shipping company they do.
B00024SKOW	this style headboom the best: easy to put in, comfortable to wear for hours, best sound in and out. people always ask what headphone im wearing as the sound is excellent. thank you nokia. please make for all phone ports including apple.
B00024SKOW	Product was defective and money was quickly returned to me. Amazon.com is the best in customer service.
B00024SKOW	Overall the HDB-5 Boom Headset for Nokia is a good product.  It is helpful for leaving hands free while driving around town.  Out on the open road it sometimes picks up too much of the road noise so that I can't hear the person I called and they have trouble hearing me.
B00024SKOW	HDB-5 Boom Headset for Nokia with 2.5mm Plug, nice product, makes easy to use mobile while doing other things. Buying through Amazon was easier.
B0013LKXEI	Works and great price sold from Top Power fulfilled by Amazon. Just needed good iPod earbuds for my dad no mic needed.
B0013LKXEI	These aren't exactly what is shown in the picture but I would definitely recommend these! They're super cheap and I will buy these again in the future!
B0013LKXEI	I LIKED THEN I THINK OTHER COSTUMERS SHOULD TRY THEN CAUSE THEY ARE VERY CINE TO CARRY AROUND AND THEY TAKE NO SPACE AT ALL.
B0013LKXEI	These are the exact earbuds that came with the iPod. Exactly what I wanted. Great price too. Quality is great.
B0013LKXEI	These headphones came pretty quick. I can say they have great service. I thought these would be like the ones you get from an iPod. They feel weird but I guess they'll do for now. It was somewhat worth it.
B0013LKXEI	These are Apple ear buds! They're just what I needed after I lost my first pair! These are better than the &#34;stereo sound&#34; ear buds that I previously purchased. Apple is the best!
B0013LKXEI	The ones that I got are not an original apple product. These are so cheaply made than the inside where the speaker is, rattles constantly. Do not buy this. The sound is horrible. The plastic came so badly bent that you can see the wire. Wasted money.
B0013LKXEI	I was replacing my earbuds and was really hesitant on spending the $30 with Apple vs. headaches with cheap imitations. So i found these and gave these a try along with some other ones. These arrived within 2 days thankfully and are great. Seriously, they might even be better if thats possible than the Apple ones. Music sounds loud and clear. The other pair i got took a week and the sound is very muffled. Big difference! Great quality product, i regret not ordering 2. Will order a back up pair!
B0013LKXEI	I really like these earbuds. The sound quality is excellent and their placement at the vestibule of the auditory canal allows me to hear environmental sounds as well as those issuing from my phone or other program source. If I keep the volume down, I can drive safely while playing my GPS through them. The plug type phones, which completely occlude the auditory canal would not allow me to do that.Still, like any product, earbuds have their limitations. They don't cancel extraneous noises and so aren't great for listening to quiet music in crowded or noisy surroundings.  The only thing I would add to this item is a microphone.  The reason that I didn't get the microphone model is that it is designed specifically with the iPhone in mind and may not work with my Samsung/Android phone.
B0013LKXEI	They are pretty good. I would buy them again, they were inexpensive and they have lasted me a while so it was worth it
B0013LKXEI	The only good thing about these headphones is the delivery time as it came three or four days after ordering. They sound okay but if they get too loud it just hurts your ears.Besides that the plastic is cheap and along with them hurting your ears when the musics up higher nafter about twenty minutes dont want to wear them.Oh and did I mention the right one didnt  work right out of the box.
B0013LKXEI	I bought these headphones and they broke within a week of use (one ear bud stopped working). I wouldn't recommend purchasing them.
B001683J9Y	I received the adapter in 2 working days.  Sound quality is great with my aftermarket headphones.  The mic is sensitive, but not too much so that it picks up extraneous noises.  Contrary to other reviews the adapter is indeed STEREO. Makes a cheap hands free in the car; plug the adapter into the phone, connect to AUX input on car stereo and calls come through the car speakers and it uses the mic on the cable.  Highly recommended!
B001683J9Y	I bought this adaptor. It only outputs in mono. I won't be using it to listen to music on my r610 :(
B001683J9Y	I bought 2 of these both for my samsung flight.  1st one angled 90 degrees down and 2nd one angled up.  1st one I got is still in one piece and works well.  2nd one I got broke apart when I dropped my phone.  Well phone dangled thanks to the adapter, but the casing for microphone fell apart.  I was able to put it together but it came apart again and the button to answer the phone disappeared.  But I was still able to use the adapter without the button.  I doubt that anyone'll need this anymore since almost all the new phones I see have both stereo adapter and micro usb.  Samsung Flight for some reason they decided to try without 3.5 stereo plug.
B001683J9Y	I purchased this adapter so I could listen to music on my SPH-M520 from Sprint. I don't subscribe to power vision, so my music is accessible only under "mass storage". Slightly inconvenient but it works. The adapter works well, the sound quality is great on my Bose headphones. The reason I only give it 4 stars is the length of the adapter. I would have preferred Samsung just leave the microphone off and shorten the cable. One other slight problem is a noticeable hissing in the headphones when flipping through menus. It seems to go away however when listening to music. Overall solid product, recommended.
B001683J9Y	The audio is every bit as good through my phone and headphones via this as through my laptop and the same headphones. The chord is irritatingly long, but I can see that being nice in some contexts.
B001683J9Y	I have been looking for this product, or one like it for a long time.I found it here, and at a good price too. Only problem was that is was lost during shipment. When I contacted the seller, Chris, an employee there re-sent the product at no charge, and it was delivered as promised. Thank you Chris.... James
B001683J9Y	Thanks for having this product available...the manufacture does not list this product even though the product contains their company name
B003C6HGVA	In the one that I got, the microphone didn't work.  Maybe it was a lemon.  When I was talking on the phone, I could hear the other person just fine, but they could not hear me.
B003C6HGVA	I bought this for my son's LG Rumor Touch and he loves it. I just wish that it didn't have foam ear buds because those are so hard to find if you need to replace them--none of the stores around me carry them.
B003C6HGVA	Extremely muffled, tinny sound. Totally useless for listening to music. What else would you buy a stereo headset for? At this price not worth the hassle of returning it, so this POS went straight into the trash.
B003C6HGVA	I bought these for my daughter's LG Rumor Touch; for the price and what it does it's a great product, nice clear quality the only down side is that the earbuds are a bit big so they might be uncomfortable for some... great buy though!
B003C6HGVA	The sound isn't crisp and clear, but I can still understand people. For the benefit of keeping less radiation away from my brain, it gets a 3 star for effort.
B003C6HGVA	Unlike the 5 dollar headphones out there that sounded like an AM radio channel, this headphone is stereo for real!PLEASE PURCHASE FROM THE SELLER ORIONGADGETS, they sell genuine OEM headphones.I bought the headphone from some other company and the quality of music sounded so badly I had to ask for a refund and return it.I have been purchasing this model of headphone since last year.The reason why I kept on purchasing it is because they break after several months of usage.But I still come back and purchase them due to the excellent sound quality at a relatively low price (probably why it breaks after several months).However, most earbud headphones won't last, either it is 5 dollars or 40 dollars, so it doesn't really matter with me.I usually order 2 or 3 at once, and that's one year supply of quality music for me.
B003C6HGVA	They Came in mint condition just like the seller said. They matched the picture they came with something a little extra which was great. The headphones for LG RUMOR TOUCH came with little ear bud covers. It was a nice touch.. What they fail to state is that, the LG RUMOR TOUCH HEADPHONES are exactly the same as regular headphones just with the talk  button thing on it. The reason I even ordered the headphones was because I thought that it was going to have that tiny piece like other phone ear pieces. Other wise GREAT PRODUCT! If you have lots of music on your LG RUMOR TOUCH and want to listen to music and talk. :) 5 STAR!!!
B004DUBV38	Volume is good, but sound quality is muffled. Mic works well; Headphones look a bit cheap though, but then price was low. Bought the blue version.
B004DUBV38	I have had the original Wicked little buds before and they lasted for 2 years they just whent out last summer so i bought a $40 pair of skull candy inked w/ inline mic and yesterday monday september 30th they bit the dust after they got caught in my bike tire while riding. So i purchased these they will be at my door step monday october 7th 2013. seeing that i owned a pair of the wicked little buds im excited to see how this new pair will preform.
B004DUBV38	These wicked litttle earbuds deliver outstanding performance for suh an inexpensive product. These were purchased for my wife, who is a professional cellist and couldn't believe her ears (literally!) The frequency range and tonal quality are excellent and although they are not noise cancelling, they do an excellent job of noise reduction.I would advise on stocking up before the supply disappears!
B004DUBV38	I don't find any problems with sound clarity. I find the sound quality on par with my last SkullCandy ear buds, and they were $10 cheaper. They sit nicely inside my ear, so it doesn't feel like they are constantly slipping out.My biggest beef is the cord is capacitive? When I drag the cord across my Galaxy S4 touch screen it actually presses buttons. I have not been able to replicate this with any cords other than these ear buds.
B004DUBV38	A Great Set Of Headphones. Good Sound Quality. I Believe The Microphone Works Well Also. I Would Buy Them Again
B004DUBV38	These are great. The price is good so I bought two because I keep losing earphones. I was surprised at the sound quality. They sound like a much more expensive set. The mic is a bonus if you use with your cell phone. Buy right away
B004DUBV38	One earbud stopped working in less than a month.  They weren't abused, they are just poor quality.  Try another brand.
B004DUBV38	It does not work well, the control has never worked quite right, it does not let me stop and start conversations on the phone or switch songs.  I will not buy this brand again
B004DUBV38	One of the earbuds broke off the day after I received it. It gets one star just for that. Sound quality is okay, not great. The only plus is that it's comfortable. Or it was, anyway.
B004DUBV38	This is one of the best set of earbuds I've purchased. The sound is HUGE and they work very well for hands-free talking on my phone while listening to my MP3 playlists. Would recommend them highly plus got them at a very good price.
