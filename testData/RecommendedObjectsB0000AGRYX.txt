B001DKRFSQ	Bought this product just before Christmas 2009. I only ended up with it because T-Mobile didn't want to give me a price break on the G1... I knew I shouldn't have settled.I should have known it was a piece of poo before I even left the store with it. As I was leaving, the T-Mobile rep told me, "When you have to do a hard reset, don't be alarmed at how long it takes to reboot." And... yep... it does take FOREVER (as in several minutes) to reboot. And... yep... you have to reboot all the time!Less than two weeks after I got the phone, it started locking up. I called T-Mobile, they said to delete any pictures, apps, or files I had on the phone. Even though I only had one ringtone and maybe 10 photos, I did what they said. No noticeable change in performance.I dealt with it for a few weeks, but it only got worse. I broke down, drove to the T-Mobile store, handed it to the rep... who performed a "software update." (By the way, I used to work for Sprint PCS... "software update" is what you do when you have absolutely no idea what is wrong with the phone.) Of course, this did no good... but whatever.I used the phone for a few more months. The problem only got worse. Another random T-Mobile rep told me to go out and buy a Mini-SD card for it. I did, and of course, no change, the problem just kept getting worse. Another T-Mobile GENIUS told me to delete everything on the phone and restore it to default condition. Soon, the phone was completely devoid of anything fun or useful... no ringtones, no photos, no apps, nothing personalized.The phone only got worse. Eventually, it was to the point where it would lock up for 10 minutes, you could use it for 3 minutes, then lock up for 10 more minutes.When it wasn't locked up, I enjoyed using the camera and enjoyed the somewhat intuitive e-mail/instant message/text functions. Of course, I didn't get to enjoy it all that often.I don't think I am biased in my dislike of BlackBerry. My best friend hates his BlackBerry Bold with a burning passion, and a family member recently returned the BlackBerry Storm after just a few days use. I am convinced that BlackBerry just plain sucks!I was so happy when an accident befell this device. I recently hopped out of my car to fill up with gas. I was in a hurry, and set the phone on top of my hood while I pumped fuel. I hopped back in the car and drove away sans Blackberry. This miserable device met its painful end somewhere near the La Cienega/Wilshire intersection in Los Angeles during Noon traffic. Problem solved.
B001DKRFSQ	This was my very first Blackberry.  I purchased it back in 2008 I think.  It was my entry into the smartphone world and I've never looked back.
B001DKRFSQ	Blackberry does not honor their warranty.  If you must get one, buy insurance.  The USB connection breaks because of poor design.  I have had two fail.  One had insurance, the other did not.  Blackberry claims that this does not happen and WILL charge you $180.  There is no escalation.  I got the device back with a broke screen and no battery (new one too).  Poor design, poor software, and the worst customer support.  You have been warned.
B001DKRFSQ	I received this phone twice.  First time I received it, it was a returned/used item.  It had someone else's emails on it.  I had it returned to Amazon. I informed them that this was a used blackberry.  They sent me another one and again, it was used because the battery door had a scratch.  I kept it anyways, when you buy blackberry for a penny, you're not guaranteed a brand new phone.  Besides, I got a rebate, so I really shouldn't be complaining.  This phone works very well.  I have the myfaves minutes, blackberry unlimited data, and the hotspot calling.  It all works well.  In my opinion, if you want reliable email and data service, blackberry is the best.  Tmobile customer service may not be that great, but what cellular provider gives the best?  Either you get a great customer service rep or you don't.  At least, their automated message service is way better than ATT and Verizon.  I can get through to customer service department by pressing zero.
B001DKRFSQ	I to am please with my black berry. its my first and a upgrade from my  regular phone and I love it I can access my email while relaxing, I love to send and recieve text it,s easy to do before with my regular phone I didn"t know how on my regular phone to complicated.  it takes beautiful pictures, I'm learning how to use more technology with this blackberry. thanks t mobile.
B001DKRFSQ	Out of all the phones I have had this is by far the best phone ever! I love it. It's camera takes great pictues that are so easy to upload to your computer. The phone it self is easy to use and keeps me stay organized!
B001DKRFSQ	I bought this model from a T mobile store on 10/10/2008. Right after the purchase, I found that a few keys are not functioning well. Then I called the store on 10/14/2008, and was told to bring it back to store for an exchange. Unfortunately, I had a business trip traveled out of US on the same day, and I returned on 10/26/2008. Therefore, I missed their 14 days of exchange time frame. For this reason, T mobile refused to exchange my phone with a new one. The reason they explained to me is that after 14 days, they have to contact the manufacturer, and it can only go under warranty. I called them 5 times. I insisted to talk to a supervisor during my 3rd call to T mobile. I was told that the supervisor was on the phone with other customers, and would call me back. I waited for the call back for the rest of day, and nobody from T mobile called me. Then I made my 4th call to T mobile on the next day. The representative told me that she would guarantee that her supervisor would call me in 24 hours. I waited for 28 hours. Still, no one from T mobile called me. At last, I made my 5th call, and was lucky enough to catch a supervisor this time. She gave me the same reason that why I can not get a new phone for replacement. I've been with Sprint for many years, and have been with Verizon for a short period. However, I have never got such a bad service! I will tell everyone I know to stay away from T mobile. They do not mean to give you the service they promise. This experience makes me feel that they are looking forward to seeing you miss the date. If you did miss for whatever reason, even if you reported the defects of the device on time, they will say `haha, I got you! It is fault! I am not going to give you exchange!'  After such experience, I will never consider using T mobile any more.
B001DKRFSQ	I purchased this phone in August right after the Sunset version of the Blackberry Curve was released. It's my first Blackberry and my first smart phone (I upgraded from a Motorola Razr). I really wanted to love this phone, but I don't. Despite its sleek appearance and numerous cool features, this Crackberry is not at all what it's cracked up to be (pun intended).First, the good things: It's pretty. It's functional and easy to use. The QWERTY keyboard is fabulous, and I finally started text messaging people because I am now able to do it without cursing. The color screen is fantastic, Web browsing is slightly above average (most mobile browsers kind of suck), and the camera is pretty decent as well. The battery life is pretty long. As for the actual phone, reception is very clear. The unit itself is a bit awkward to hold against the ear, but it's not a flip phone and I could always get with the program and buy a hands-free device, so I'm not going to complain about that.However, despite all those great features, I hate this stupid phone. My biggest complaint is that it locks up on me ALL THE TIME! That blue hourglass appears on the screen about 70% of the time I have the phone turned on. The constant "updating" makes the rest of the device slow and sluggish, and to my knowledge there is no way to speed that up. Also, sometimes the hourglass refuses to go away after 10 or 15 minutes, and I'm forced to take the entire battery out and reboot my phone, which is also time consuming. That happens at least once a week. In addition to that, my phone apparently came with some sort of poltergeist, because sometimes the red light will flash and the phone will start beeping WHEN IT'S TURNED OFF! Plus, although I have the settings adjusted to store e-mails and text messages for 30 days, sometimes the phone decides to delete everything all by itself without even prompting me (and not necessarily just when I have a ton of messages in the inbox, either). Finally, this phone does not shoot video! I suppose it's my own fault for not realizing that it lacked that feature before I made the purchase, but I seriously did not expect a $250 phone to lack something as simple as video capabilities. Ridiculous!The bottom line is, even though this is a nice looking phone, I have had more problems with it than any other mobile device (I actually miss my old Razr!). If T-Mobile offered the iPhone, I would ditch my Crackberry in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'm stuck with this stupid thing for a while longer.
B001DKRFSQ	I resisted a Blackberry for years because I didn't want my email following me everywhere.  Finally broke down and got this Curve 3 weeks ago.  It truly lives up to its name as a "smart phone."The Good:1--The preloaded applications.  I LOVE having mapping and search technology right on my cellphone!  No more wondering where the nearest Wells Fargo or Pinkberry is.  No more wasting time in the doctor's waiting room.  I can check/respond to email or better yet, play tetris or brickbreaker.2 --Multi-Tasking.  If you are in the middle of one app (e.g., entering an address) and a call comes in, when the call is finished, the screen goes back to what you were doing instead of losing all the data you just entered.  Coming from regular phones, this is a HUGE time-saving improvement for me.  Also, if you are on the phone with someone and you want to look up a number or an email or a calendar event on your phone, you can click a button and search for the info, all while continuing your convo with the caller.  How novel that technology should actually work the way common sense dictates.  I uploaded a software called Mobile Tracker that works with a GPS to track my movements (which I can later upload in a file and watch on Google Earth) and the tracking is done in the background all while I continue to make and receive calls, check email, etc.  Love that!3--The Keyboard (Characters).  I love that all the letters, numbers and common symbols are on one keyboard instead of my having to scroll thru multiple screens like most other phones.4--Phone quality.  Speakerphone is crisp and clear.  Phone can hold a signal even in certain dead spots.The Bad:1-- Battery life is not great.  Requires daily charging but I use it quite intensely.  Easily solved with a car charger.2-- Browser is sometimes a little too slow for my taste.  This may be the phone or it may be t-mobile.  I haven't tested to know whether wi-fi makes the browser go faster than being on the EDGE network.  Also, could be slower when there are multiple applications working in the background.The Ugly:1--The keyboard (surface).  Not crazy about the texture.  I prefer the feel of the Bold's keyboard but I'm not going to switch carriers for it.2--So incompatible with Mac it's not funny.  After 3 days of trying different alternatives (the free pocketmac from blackberry froze my computer), I had to pay $40 for Missing Sync software to make the phone play nice with Mac, and even then there are issues.  If you have a windows pc, you won't have this issue.  If you have a Mac, be prepared to accept less than accurate syncing.3--The manual.  It's beyond useless.  Doesn't tell you anything about this phone which has menus within menus within menus.  There are a lot of features and you really need to take it out on a date and get to know it intimately.  I have started to create my own little "how-to" file to keep track of how to do everything on this phone.If you are new to smartphones, you will really enjoy this phone, not just for the email but for the constant access to the internet which is great for having information at your fingertips when you're away from your computer.NOTE:  A week or so after getting the phone, I also experienced the problem mentioned by the reviewer below with the phone locking up and the interminable hourglass.  When I went in to each of the programs on the phone I had opened (maps, browser, weather channel, missing sync, brickbreaker, etc) and selected Close or Quit from the menu, this problem went away.  I guess what makes this a smart phone is that hitting the back button on the phone just takes you to the previous screen but it doesn't automatically close out the application you are working in.  You have to do that manually.UPDATE:  It has now been more than 6 months since I have had the phone and I want to throw it into the ocean.  I still love the map feature and the camera has come in handy a couple of times, but the phone part drives me nuts!  #ver since I activated the UMA feature which allows me to make calls over my highspeed Internet connection, I have had constant dropped calls, call failures, inability to dial out or receive calls.  The phone basically works when it feels like.  I have called T-Mobile but the support on this particular feature is useless.  You might ask, why don't I just disable it, but when it works, it's brilliant -- it's like being on a landline.  And cell service in my home is spotty so if I don't use UMA, I have to stand in one corner of the house.  I had the phone set to work exclusively with UMA and I had problems so I switched it so that the phone would go back and forth between UMA and Edge, but I still have problems.  This could be the phone, this could be T-Mobile, this could be my internet connection, who knows.  I haven't tested UMA over another wireless network to isolate the problem.  Perhaps I will do that next and update the review again.
B001DKRFSQ	The curve is a downgrade from previous models. WiFi and gps barely work. You need a very strong signal for wifi. No 3G. The most annoying part is that you will have to change all your chargers and adapters because they changed the connector. The old mini-USB cable was very handy because it is shared by many manufactures so it was very easy to find someone to help you out in case you run out of battery on the road. Not anymore. Do not waste your money.
B001DKRFSQ	I am very happy with this keep-in-touch instrument.  I replaced an ordinary cellphone with this, so it's a real step up for me.  Being able to check on, and send, emails from just about anywhere is a real revelation! It just eliminates the need to be attached to a base during working hours.  It was also easy to set up and is easy to use.  Can you tell I'm happy with it?
B0026P3T46	I've owned both the Rumor and the Rumor2, and I'm torn between which I like better.  The first big difference is the QWERTY pad - the original did not have a dedicated number line or a smiley button, both of which are nice.  However, having spent almost a year with the Rumor, I'm having to re-learn where certain buttons are (namely the enter button, and that there's also a dedicated period button), but that's to be expected with any new phone.I do miss my camcorder on the original Rumor.  Had I spent more time at the store (yes, Sprint Customer Service was driving me nuts and I just wanted to get out of there with my wallet intact), I would have noticed that it didn't have a camcorder, and might have gone with a different phone.However, that is more than made up for by the threaded text messaging (very nice when you're trying to recall a conversation, so you don't have to keep jumping between the inbox and sent box), as well as the onslaught of alarms.  The original Rumor had 3 alarms plus a quick (1min, 10min, 30min, 1hr).  The Rumor 2 has 5 alarms, plus a "Walk the Dog" alarm (as well as three different ringers revolving around walking your dog), and the quick alarm.  Probably my favorite feature?  Once again, the microSD capacity has been bumped up - this time to 16gigs!!! I'm still working to fill my 4gig that I had in the Rumor, but I suppose that once 16gig cards drop in price the way the 2s and 4s have, I'll find myself buying a bigger card.  Beware, though, with a bigger card and more music, it takes longer and longer to load the music player.Speaking of which, the music player has some nice updates from the original Rumor as well.  Again, as someone who's been through way too many phones (9 in the last 4 years, to be exact), I have had the Fusic with it's music player (by far my favorite), the Musiq with it's player (the Java based piece of junk, which was only good because I could put the player in the background and still use my phone 100% for other apps), the Rumor (very basic player, just with shuffle & repeat functions), and now this one.  It's still closest to the original Rumor in that I can't create different playlists (at least, in the 24 hours of owning it, I haven't found a way to yet), but it does have the option of playing songs in a list or having it shown as a player with the song information and time remaining. Again, still pretty basic, but a ton better than the original Rumor.Overall, I'm just happy that I have a phone that isn't quirky (yet), one that has a killer QWERTY and text layout, and one that takes pretty decent pics for a 1.3 camera.  Again, lots of alarm choices, the music player's decent, and not too much new to learn from the original Rumor.  If I find anything else worth mentioning, I'll try to remember to bring it up :)
B0026P3T46	i love this phone it have a mp3,easy acess to texting,the way it slides so easy,its nice keyboard with itts happy face witch meand emotions if i were u i would get this phone i love it it made my life so much better!
B0026P3T46	I like this phone, but it comes with nothing.  You will need to buy the USB cord and attachment for headphones separately, which was annoying.  The camera works fine and the keyboard layout is nice.  The music player os basic and stalls when changing between songs.
B0026P3T46	This review is for the LG Rumor 2 phone, not the service (Sprint.)Positives: The slide-out keyboard is nice, making it much easier to type for someone does a lot of text messaging.Negatives:- The buttons on top are easily pressed. Any holster I have tries puts enough pressure to randomly push buttons. The phone will lock itself after inactivity, but the timeout is long enough that putting it into a holster or in a pocket will pretty much guarantee pushing buttons, random butt-dialing or menu activation, etc.- "Missed Alerts" will stay active even after viewing a text message. Sometimes I have to go back to the same message a couple of times before the phone recognizes it as read.- Camera locks up: After a couple of months, sometimes when I select the camera, the phone freezes up and I have to remove and replace the battery to get it to reboot.It would be a much better phone with a little more attention paid to guarding the exposed buttons from unintended presses. I'm not going to return it but if it breaks or gets damaged soon, I will be happy to buy a new phone that doesn't have these issues.
B0026P3T46	I love the slideout qwerty keyboard and the sleek design.  The only thing I would say needs improvement is that the ring tone volume could be louder.
B0026P3T46	Only bad thing it's not waterproof! Loved it for over 2yrs.Just pulled it out of WASHING MACHINE, was hoping to find another one here.No such luck.
B0026P3T46	I am not here to bash Amazon, in fact I am very impressed by the website itself. My main concern is this piece of technology. I have it, and I hate it. The "Outer Coating" chips off easily and with a year of use the buttons start to fade. I have had multiple issues with the phone freezing when I try to take pictures and so on. Right now I am having an issue with the "headset mode", it continuously pops up in the middle of a text message saying it has turned on, then it says it turned off 3 seconds later. Not only is this confusing, it is equally as frustrating. The screen scratches easy and mine, currently, is starting to chip off. I take good care of my technology, so why is this happening? That is a question that I cant answer but save yourself the trouble and go look at another phone.Don't get me wrong this phone is alright, but thats only if you need a phone to get you through a couple months. If you are looking for something that lasts in appearance as well as function this is not the option for you.
B0026P3T46	Pretty good. The GPS was simple and effective. I have had it for three months and have been pleased with over all performance. The keyboard is simple and smooth. I recomend it. My previous phone was the Black Berry Pearl which was the most frustrating phone I have ever owned.
B0026P3T46	Good phone. Reasonable price for service. Sprint Customer service needs to polish their listening skills.
B0026P3T46	I have two of these phones and each one now flashes the 'Hello' start up screen over and over and over.  I am informed that this is due to a bug in the softwares phone.  When two keys (don't know which) are pressed, it puts the phone in debug mode.  What a piece of junk!!  Buy a different phone.  LG stinks.
B002VJK47C	Lots of people want a touchscreen phone, but most of the models available are expensive with lots of high-end hardware.  A touchscreen display is just an alternative interface, and there is no reason why only expensive phones should have it.The first thing I noticed is that the touchscreen, though it is of the cheaper "resistive" type, actually works OK.  A resistive touchscreen is the older kind, with a thin flexible plastic layer which you press your finger against, and it bends to make a connection with the layer beneath it (compared to the "capacitative" type, which is a solid surface that can sense your finger's touch by its electrical field effect).  I actually found that some of the HTC-made capacitative screens require more pressure to work than the Tap.The menu is simple, well-organized, and offers a "widget" bar on the main screen.  The widget bar is a one-dimensional stack of regular menu options, which you can "drag-and-drop" onto the main screen.Despite the great standard setup and the cool widget bar, the phone lacks more advanced shortcut and customization options.  The settings menu is fairly straight-forward, but also doesn't offer as much as more advanced phones.  It lacks a key feature missing from most phones, which is the ability to make shortcuts directly to Java applications (such as an email-provider's app, or Google maps, or the Opera browser).The web browser works fairly fast.  The phone has 3g access, which is not available in all areas so "your experience may vary".  But it seems to have a fast enough processor (some phones have slow browsing just because they can't process well).  Opera Mini was running smoothly, and the built-in browser worked fine as well.  No annoying delays in responding to screen/key presses.
B002VJK47C	I like the phone, but I can't get with this touch screen. However overall it is a great phone with lots of apps to have fun with.
B002VJK47C	The phone works very well and as advertised.  We love the android OS and best of all, it is not an Apple!  No issues so far with the touch screen.  I don't send many texts or emails from my phone, but the QWERTY keypad is very good.  Fat fingers could struggle though.  However, the word suggestion helps if you get close to the intended word.  One con is that there really is no way to learn about all of the stuff the phone can do.  We have picked up most of what we know from other users or the community forums.  The available apps are still somewhat limited compared to the fruit phone, but there seem to more added each week.  I have yet to pay for any applications, so many remain free.  Actual phone call quality is pretty good, not surprising as Verizon has decet coverage.
B002VJK47C	I paid $200 for this phone... Wish I had bought something else. The TAP features work good on the large icons, but the tiny "qwerty" keyboard works much better with a #2 pencil eraser. It also dosn't play well with my "Plantronics BackBeat 906 Bluetooth headset" "Motorola S9-HD Headset". Pairs up OK with either headset, but locks on phone and stops pairing with iPod or any other audio source. I may be doing something wrong, but I have been using Bluetooth for more than two years, and feel confident in my understanding and ability to use this technology.
B002VJK47C	Fantastic phone.While the onscreen keyboard is a little cramped, it is still easy to use because of being calibrated to my touch style. The click and drag of the widgets takes a little getting used to, as does the fact that I haven't been able to find a speed dial option. However, the quick access of the call log from the dialer screen makes this pretty much a moot point.I don't have the web package plan, but I know that once I do I won't need to upgrade to another phone for A LONG TIME. This is an affordable touch screen that deserves it's 'very good' rating from [...].
B002VJK47C	Love the concept of the Droid Eris--love the look, the feel, the "coolness" of having it.  NOW, if I could only see the printing I'd be even happier.  I thought surely there would be an app to embolden the print or make it larger for the progressive lens set but there is not.  I should report to the Americans with Disabilities Act as anyone over 55 probably needs a magnifying glass to read it.  I've had my phone since February and just can't cope so finally going back to my trusty Blackberry with bold letters and manual keyboard.  I'm 60 and trying to stay up with the times.  I refuse to use a JITTERBUG!!!  also...THE BATTERY LIFE is extremely short even when using the Task manager to shut down unused apps.  I FIND MYSELF RECHARGING AT LEAST TWICE A DAY.
B002VJK47C	I just got this phone over the weekend. This is my first Touch Screen phone so I have nothing else to compare it to. It's very nice. Very pretty phone. I love the Berry color.This phone has a virtual qwerty keyboard for texting. This is the #1 feature I had to have for a phone. It's very simple to use. I love that I can set my favorite song as the ring tone. MP3 player works great. I can assign a photo to a contact so a picture comes up when someone is calling. Very cute! You do not have to have a data plan for this phone. I only have a talk & text plan. Games are fun. Cheap to download.My main complaint is when taking a photo, the photo is saved flipped to 90 degrees. You have to edit the photo to flip it around again and resave.A suggestion, when putting new contacts into your phone, make sure you fix the settings to save contacts to your sim card before hand or it will only save to your phone.I am a mom of two teenagers so I had to get a texting phone to communicate easier with them. I am not real cell phone saavy so I love that this phone is very user-friendly! Fits my needs wonderfully!
B003HC8QZE	I got this phone yesterday and spent 6 hrs on the phone with support, trying to get the screen to work and to add Gmail.  I unloaded, reloaded, set and reset, booted and rebooted, as the Vzw support seemed unusually confused. They had to get a phone, get the manual, ask their coworkers, and escalate multiple times.  Finally an unusally surly Vzw service rep who handled the escalation had me wipe out the memory of everything I had done so far, change my Gmail P/w and when that didn't work he blamed me and Gmail.
B003HC8QZE	I got this phone thinking that it was just going to be a normal phone. But it's not! This phone is amazing! It's keyboard is nice and spaced, It's screen is a good size, And the touch screen is nice and responsive. I have no cons as of yet and I've had the phone for about 2 weeks. I would definitely recommend this phone!
B003HC8QZE	I love this phone. I don't understand why some people are saying this is the worst phone ever because It is NOT!!!! Let's go into what is good about this phone.1. It does NOT turn on by itself. If your phone turns on by it self then you did not set it right. All you have to do is go to "Settings and tools" then go to "Display Settings". Once your there go down to #8 which is Unlock Screen. Once you go there make sure you pick Lock Key Only. If you do that then your phone won't turn on by it self. I have had this phone for almost 2 years and I have NOT had one thing go wrong with it.2. If you put your own memory card in it does NOT slow down your phone.3. The touch screen is so easy to use. Nothing to complain about there for the touch screen.4. The camera takes WONDERFUL pictures. I love the kinda pictures it takes.5. It also takes good video.6. The battery if good. It last long.7. When you are texting it will keep all the messages with the contact you are texting. It all stays there so you don't have to look through all the messages just to get the the message you want.8. When making calls they are clear and wonderful. I have not had one problem with calling or it cutting off on me.If you guys have any questions just ask me and I will be glad to answer any questions. I love Verizon and I have been with them for 12 plus years.
B003HC8QZE	This is good "starter" smart phone. The only real gripe I have with it is the wallpapers frequently change back to the default papers by itself which I find a little annoying. Also the tape on the back side of the screen tends to come loose after awhile. Verizon no longer offers this phone. If you want it, you will have to find it here on amazon or ebay.
B003HC8QZE	I was going to write a reasoned, thorough review of this phone, but now I see there is not much point. After introducing it just a few months ago with much fanfare, Samsung has already pulled it from the market. But just in case they try to inflict it on us again in an 'updated' version, let me tell you why it's so awful. The worst thing is that even if you lock the phone, it turns itself on and does whatever it pleases, including modifying your data, connecting to the web, and placing calls. I have repeatedly heard voices from my pocket and found that it had dialed one of my contacts without me even knowing about it!Other bad points include (a) a touch screen so bad that you can't touch the screen to scroll a list without opening the item you touched, which makes it nearly impossible to use the contact list; (b) a lousy menu system that is so confusing it must have been designed by a sadist, (c) a screen that scratches much too easily, (d) a nearly useless web browser, and (e)games and applications that aren't even sized to fit the screen and make you navigate with arrow keys rather than use the touch-screen feature.Samsung, could you have done any worse? You owe every single person who bought this phone a full refund plus compensation for all the time they wasted trying to get the damn thing to work. I won't hold my breath.
B003HC8QZE	I've had an issue with this phone as well, but it had nothing to do with the phone breaking (had it for a little over a year & nothing has ever broken on it), for me it has more to do with the mobile email setup.I have several email accounts set up through the phone, at least 2-3, so that it notifies me when new emails arrive to these accounts, the problem is that every once in a while it won't let me log into a particular account (usually a yahoo or msn associated account). I have even tried deleting an account off the phone and re-adding it, or turning the phone off & back on, hoping that would fix the issue..sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. I go through this at least once every 2 weeks. It's frustrating having a phone that's unpredictable (well I guess it is predictable now knowing it's gonna act up every so often).I have a facebook account and it's gotten to the point that I have to change the primary email every couple of weeks all because the phone won't access whatever email was the primary one before. In fact, I had to log into my facebook account to change the primary email again minutes before writing this review.So if you want a phone where all you want to do is just make & receive calls and not use any email features, then by all means feel free to go for this one. But if you're a person like me who checks emails regularly through your phone, you might wanna pass on this one and look elsewhere.
B003HC8QZE	The phone is OK for the basic functions for any phone.However for the other function like email or the web it is lacking.The size is just little too small for me.I sent mine back and order a smart phone.
B003HC8QZE	I love my phone. I ordered it through Verizon, because I was due for an upgrade. It only cost me 20 ish bucks. But it is a great phone. The touchpad works well. No problems. Exceppttttt....The only issue is if you insert an optional memory card. This seems to slow the phone down a bit. Anytime the phone is locked and you go to unlock it, there is a 1 1/2 second delay. No BIG problem...but it's noticeable.Great phone. Highly recommended.
B003HC8QZE	I am in love with this phone.  I actually ordered the certified pre-owned version with Verizon.Initially I was not sure because touch phones can be a little, well, touchy.  After having it a week I am pretty satisfied with the phone.  It does what it needs to do and within a day you can get used to it.The key board is a little small, and I think I may have deleted my entire camera card, but other than that, the phone is perfect for me!
B003HC8QZE	I originally bought this phone about a year ago because it got good reviews here. (thanks a lot, people!) Little did I know what kind of nightmare I was in for. Someone else mentioned that the phone turns on by itself in your pocket. This is a major headache. Whenever I sat down, got up or moved a certain way, the phone would turn itself on. It sometimes dialed by itself. I was able to lock that aspect, but I couldn't control how it turned on and off. The main problem is that the power button is raised instead of depressed, so the slightest touch to it turns it on. This is just shoddy workmanship. I got a clip to put it on my belt instead and ended up losing the phone at a movie theater. Then Verizon made me get the same exact phone again (they wouldn't let me upgrade or even downgrade because I was locked into my contract). I complained repeatedly, and got nowhere. So I eventually just went to another service. Even if I have to pay an early termination fee, it's worth it, because I absolutely HATED this phone. It was an albatross around my neck the whole time I had it.The sound of it turning itself on and off all the time was driving me nuts. It got to the point where I stopped carrying it around with me and kept it in my briefcase. Then I'd forget to use it for days. I am overjoyed to finally be free of this hellish phone. If you want a touch screen phone, get something decent like an Iphone or Android. Don't get this second-rate phone. You'll regret it. I guess they stopped making it - but be careful whenever you buy a Samsung phone. I'm sure there are some good ones, but if this one is any indication, they have pretty awful quality control. This phone should never have been put on the market.I only gave this phone a one-star review because Amazon wouldn't let me choose "No Stars!"
B003HC8QZE	With all the wonderful features of this phone: large screen, nice keyboard, touch screen, internet access, etc., it's a real shame that they made the music player so limited!  You have no choice but to listen to your songs alphabetically.  Now, if you want to go in and manually change all the MP3 tags so that the song name within the MP3 file has 01.., 02.., 03.., 04.., etc, added to each file, THEN you can listen to your songs in their original order (the order they come on the CD), but otherwise you have to listen to them in ALPHABETICAL ORDER (one of the most useless orders I can think of -- almost as bad as RANDOM).And it doesn't matter if the actual ripped file has 01.., 02.., 03.. prefixing the filename; it'll just ignore that!!  It has to be done inside the file's MP3 data, or within Windows Media Player's "Advanced Tag Editor" (the pop-up menu you get when you Right-click a file name).  Very time-consuming.Maybe I just missed the easy fix for this, but I have searched and searched and searched, and other than manually changing all the ID tags, you're just out of luck.  Sadly, One Star removed for this bungle on Samsung's part.Otherwise, an excellent phone with a great look and feel and functionality.
B003HC8QZE	I did some research before purchasing this phone, including talking to several Verizon Wireless reps.  Two of them told me that the phone has a calendar scheduler which can sync with the google calendar (as well as other calendars such as outlook calendar), which really got my expectations up. After I purchased the phone, I found that its internal calendar wouldn't sync with google calendar--although google calendar has a way for it to be displayed on the cellphone.Then, for some reason, I started hearing loud static noise when I made any phone calls. Several times people told me that they couldn't hear me. They would try again and it still wouldn't work.  This was really annoying so I went to a verizon wireless store and exchanged for another phone (and lost all my saved notes, calendar items, etc), also Samsung Reality. Now the static noise is gone, but the phone often freezes--after some time the phone would turn off by itself and restart again. This happened several times after I used the "search" function (within the phone, not online), and when I touched a calendar item matching my search term in the results. I don't know what's causing the problem and am beginning to wonder whether I need to take the phone back for another one, or should I get a different phone.
B003HC8QZE	I bought this phone for my son and he loves it. It has everything he wants in it. It is a great touch screen phone. But you have to pay for the data package for this phone.
B003HC8QZE	Before I bought this phone I checked the reviews on both the Verizon site and Amazon. The only bad reviews I could find seemed to be either user error or phone malfunctions(always a smart move to have the $5 a month phone insurance for any phone!). My opinion is that this phone is fantastic. It does everything it says it does. I must admit I didn't buy it to have full access to the internet and browsing away from a full functioning computer (can't afford that plan!). It has limited access on my plan to facebook and myspace, bing and others, and any google searches. I wasn't looking for much more than that.The touch screen is great. Clear and easy to use (I do have fingernails and that helps. My husband does struggle trying to use it with his fat fingers). The internal user functions (ie card formatting, moving pictures, text & pic messaging etc) is extremely user friendly. The phone even comes with a tutorial for special features (for those who never read the manual :-)) and a callibration unit for the touch screen (for fat finger users I assume).I've never been happier with a phone I bought, especially for it's price. It does everything it says and is easy to use. I would recommend it to any friend.
B003HC8QZE	THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION (based on purchase in early August):I have been a loyal Verizon user since 2001.  My plan has me using a phone in the "3G Multimedia" class - it's no smart phone, but I get more use out of it than I would a "feature phone".  My last phone was a Voyager - touchscreen with physical qwerty keyboard underneath, clamshell form factor, expandable memory (sd slot), capable of playing playing unprotected mp3, wma or aac audio files and 3G2 video files.  I had been planning on moving up to the EnV Touch, but when that proved much more expensive, settled for this.At the time, I was able to get this phone for $[...] (after rebate, of course).  It's slimmer and lighter than the Voyager, and going from clamshell to slider form factor wasn't as difficult as I'd expected (all those bad reviews I'd seen for the EnV Touch didn't hurt either).  The Reality plays the same media files as the Voyager with ease, and transferring media back and forth between the phone and a computer is fast and easy - no add-on software is needed.  (If you get your videos in avi format, you'll probably need conversion software like Quick Media Converter to convert to 3G2, but that shouldn't be difficult.)  In fact, all I had to do was take the card out of the voyager and insert it into the Reality and everything just moved with it.Calls:Call quality was good in my area.  dialing is easy, made easier by being able to quikly scroll through the directory of contacts (this was a slow moving chore on the Voyager, smoothed on this phone by being able to scroll through letters of the directory).  No dropped calls...yet.Texting:This was made easier for frequent contacts - the Reality doesn't just save your messages, but saves the last contacts you've either sent or received messages from.  This makes it easier to respond or follow a train of thought between texts.  On the other hand, the keyboard for the Reality is (unfortunately) clearly inferior to the Voyager - the buttons are spongier and more sunken in than the keys on my older phone.Camera:Nobody in their right mind would have chosen the Voyager for its camera, and the 3+ MP on the Reality beats it.  It's still no replacement for a dedicated camera (or one on a smart phone) but it takes decent pictures.Touch screen and general interface:Nobody will ever confuse the touch screen on either of my Verizon phones with the iPod Touch.  the screen on the Verizon phones are cranky - they don't do what they are told to.  You need to know how the screen likes to be touched.  Samsung put a lot of functionality onboard, and that's probably more than the phone's feeble processor can take.  There's a widget menu (pull off from the side) from which you can quickly check calendars, listen to music, look at pictures, check the weather.  Don't like the widget you've pulled, just dump it back onto the widget menu.  On-screen widgets don't move around that easily though, making it easy to clutter the screen up.  Add to this the fact that your home screen comes with three wall papers and it's easy for your home screen to become harder to navigate.Internet.Let's face it, the carriers want you to move to a smartphone, and they've probably decided that phones like this will be needed to remind subscribers what they get when they pay for a more expensive phone.  While the phone brings up web pages quickly, navigating those pages is a chore.  The weak memory of the Reality means that there's just so much your phone will display before running low.  Scrolling can take forever, and just trying to zoom in and out is needlessly complicated - no "pinch & zoom" here.  It helps to have a few simple pages to go to (weather, news, maybe your transit c carrier) but mobile surfing is out of this phone's league.The reality of the situation is that the Samsung Reality is a great phone for users who don't want an expensive phone and plan.  Once you kniow it's limits, it's very handy and reliable.  While you may opt for a smartphone in your future, the Reality is enough of a multimedia device to make your standalone music player obsolete.
B003HC8QZE	Upon initial observation and use, the phone was clearly designed by someone with the intent to give the people what they want. But, its abilities are severely limited in areas of bluetooth, ringtones, and other file management areas. It was designed have excellent control over these areas. But in reality (ha) it is severely lacking. In stead of JAVA, it uses... BREW ?! Good luck with apps. If one just wants a good texting phone and ability to make a call then here you go. Other than that, don't expect too much.
B003HC8QZE	Note: This is for the red color phone but since there are more reviews on the black phone, I'm putting the Reality review here. [The Piano Red is a really nice color :-)]This is my first internet-enabled phone.  It does exactly what I needed to.  In addition to calling, I text a ton and occasionally use the internet to check ESPN, GMail, or get directions.  [The BING application is wondrous for directions for a phone of this kind.]I wish that GMail was easier to check (there may be a way that I don't know), and wallpapers change with the touch of a button along with app buttons.Overall, while most people have a Droid phone, I'm pretty happy with this basic phone.  [I'm usually two years behind the curve with most technology :-)]No negative comments on call clarity, reception, ease of dial4ing etc.  Nothing seems wrong with basic phone usage.
B003HC8QZE	From day one I didn't think my screen was acting right. It would be uneven some times but when I touched it would straighten up. Now after only having it a month the phone is unusable. The screen gets all distorted and unreadable. I keep having to turn the phone on and off after making or receiving call or else I can't read the screen. Verizon is sending me a refurbished phone.I'm starting to wish I had kept my Env 2 it took a lot of abuse and kept working strong.I wouldn't recommend this phone. It feels flimsy and the battery life is terrible.
B004H4XGH4	Being a Star Wars enthusiast, my family got me the R2D2 phone for my birthday in January of 2011.  In the 2 years I have had it, I have only had a few issues and all were able to be remedied quite simply or were mere glitches that seemed to work themselves out.I am well past due for my upgrade but cannot seem to part with my R2.Unfortunately, my navigation has recently decided only to take me to a single destination.  Once I &#34;exit navigation&#34; I get only a white screen and have to turn off the phone and allow it to reset before navigating anywhere else.  As I will be traveling quite a bit (with children and a strict time schedule) in the coming months, I am hoping there may be a fix for this also.  Otherwise it may be time to say &#34;I've lost R2&#34;.No matter the outcome, I think this is the longest any phone has lasted me.  I love it!
B004H4XGH4	Hi there! I had the droid x before I exchanged it for this one. The droid x was just to big for me. This phone is a bit better for me since the shape is just right and it has physical keyboard which I love! The only problem I had with it was when I received it, it already had scratches on the camera lens, and nick on the back left side of the phone. I'm not sure about how amazon gets these phones but this phone is great overall just came with a bit of cosmetic blemishes.
B004H4XGH4	A new every two upgrade, $53 got me this phone.  R2d2 benefited from all bug fixes complained off for the prior 6 months for Droid 2, so this phone functions without a glitch.  Everything that should happen, does happen.  Phone quality and reception is as good as most dedicated phones; downloading Android Marketplace apps, syncing with google, etc., are all flawless.  I migrated 700 phone numbers from my Palm phone easily, but it was tougher to get Palm dba schedules into google.  PC sync is easy, just plug it in, and it becomes a virtual drive.  Removable microSDHC cards are a plus, as you can upgrade memory when needed, and use multiple cards to keep a lot of multimedia, swapping when needed.Most Android apps I use are free, and many equivalent ones I reviewed need to be purchased for use on an iPhone.Unlike most phones I've owned since 1995, r2d2 consumes batteries faster because its more like a real handheld multitasking PC with a phone, that just a phone + PDA as most smartphones used to be. Without any use, it drops 10% a day, and with computer usage, it depends on what you do.  Charging is fast, 50% to 100% in ~ 1 hour, and original Moto batteries are now only $5, so easy to get extras if needed, and its easily user replaceable.The biggest flaw in r2d2 is Android's internal security, encryption, which is well known as of this writing.  We await the new API and Moto is making their own to fix this flaw sooner than the Android developers.  You can get Apps that can do it for you right now, but its clunky and works only on a per application basis, rather than global.
B004H4XGH4	I was so excited to receive this phone!  Upon arrival, I noticed that below the camera lens, the rear panel (above the battery cover, next to the camera) was sticking up a little.  Assuming that it was supposed to be that way, I activated my phone.  Within a week, the rear panel was peeling up more and more.  If I pushed the panel down, it would stay for about an hour and then pop up again.  I spoke to Amazon and they told me that because it was a cosmetic problem and did not interfere with making calls, they would not replace the phone.  Thinking this defect would be something that is covered under the 1-year manufacturer's warranty, I contacted Motorola.  They told me that I would have to pay for the repair (and shipping) as the warranty only covers the software.  How ridiculous.  As a long-time Motorola supporter, I'm very disappointed that they don't guarantee the quality of their products.  I regret not shipping the phone back to Amazon right away.  Yes, it was a minor problem.  However, it was something that would definitely get worse over time.  Figuring I have nothing to lose in terms of voiding the pretty much nonexistent warranty, I have attempted to fix the problem myself with a little superglue...hopefully it stays put.My sister also bought this phone and has call clarity issues (which I haven't had).  We're on the same network.  So, I just want to warn others to inspect their phone carefully before activating it.  Other than the quality issues, I have enjoyed the phone (even though I've only had it for a week and a half).
B004H4XGH4	I love all things Star Wars especially R2. If you ask my 2 yr old daughter what she wants to watch she'll chose Star Wars over SpongeBob! I'm glad so many love their phones..I just wish I could say the same. I received mine on Oct 3, 2010 and within hours the media stopped working which meant no pics, no video including the special R2 one, no music, no you tube, nothing. Went to the store and after an hour they were able to get it working. It would work for a bit and then I'd have to take it back in, each time having to redo all icons and page set ups and download all previous apps again. By the fourth visit they got tired of me and decided to send a replacement. Opened the package and saw that the panel under the camera was sticking up and peeling off. These are thin panels(looks like some kind of thin metal) which really hurt when you reach in your pocket and the corner piece thats sticking up jabs your fingers! But It worked just fine(which is what I was hoping for so I kept it)  for about a month and started shutting itself off after calls and texts. Annoying yes, 'but just turn it back on' you say. I would've if it would let me. It seemed to have a mind of its own. After a few min of trying to turn it on I would give up. Anywhere between 5-45 minutes later you would hear R2D2's welcoming message that it was turned on again! Along with that, the keyboard light would turn off (usually only at night when you needed it), and the touch screen wouldn't work about 20% of the time to be able to answer a call. The phone would ring but you couldn't answer it. 2 store visits later and one visit from a very angry husband got me my third phone(second replacement). Within minutes the camera, video and music didn't work like my first phone. My husband called and got through to a technician who swiped my SD card clean. Been a few days and the camera and media issues seem ok but tonight it started turning itself off after calls so now it has the problems of my first and second phones combined! One bad phone..ok. two bad phones..really? Three bad phones..speechless! Who's to blame..the maker or the seller?Who's more the fool..the fool or the fool that follows? - Obi Wan (original)
B004H4XGH4	My husband and I each purchased the Motorola R2-D2 Droid 2 and love it!  The graphics on the back are NOT a sticker, as a previous reviewer stated.  It is easy to use and the battery, if managed properly, is adequate.  It also charges very quickly.  If you love Star Wars and Motorola Droid, you will adore this phone.  Who would not love being alerted to a call or text by R2-D2's beeps and whistles?!
B004H4XGH4	I had long been looking to join the smart phone `Army'.  But, being a loyal customer of Verizon Wireless left me out of luck for iPhone until just very recently.  So, I rolled along with some lesser phones, including a woefully out of date Palm Centro.  With there still being no guarantees of the iPhone coming out on Verizon, I started looking at the Droid phones.The Droid came across as the answer to those who didn't want to deal with Apple or who just wanted a different type of fully realized smart phone.  So, when my upgrade time came along, the Droid 2 had just been released, along with its special edition cousin, the Droid R2-D2.  Being a Star Wars geek, I went with the Droid R2-D2.I can honestly say that this is the first phone that I wasn't looking to upgrade to the latest and greatest within the first 2 months of owning it.  It has a physical slide out keyboard (important because I don't like the virtual touch screen keyboards), yet it is not bulky as a result.  The touch screens operate fairly smoothly and consistently.  The menu of Apps available from the Droid Marketplace is considerable and I have enjoyed using them on my system (especially Angry Birds).The only drawbacks for the phone include relatively short battery life (which, I understand, is problem with most smart phones) and a weird set of circumstances where you sometimes try to click on the power button to activate the touch screen and it, instead, shuts down the phone instantly.  This is an annoyance more than a true hassle.Overall, I am very pleased with this phone.  I will upgrade again when my upgrade date comes along.  However, I won't be chomping at the bit to do it one moment sooner because this is a stellar phone.(NOTE:  The R2-D2 edition does include some special Stars Wars themed videos, sound effects, and wallpapers).
B005XC6ZZE	I understand that battery life with most smartphones isn't great. This is my first smartphone (other than my work Blackberry, which I hate) so I'm still getting used to all the capabilities.With all that capability comes many functions and apps that run in the background. I understand disabiling the auto update and various other background functions(GPS antenna is a big draw on power) improves battery life, but also reduces the functionality of the phone.So, in short, keep your charger or a spare battery handy if you use the phone a lot. I can get 3 hours talk time and running apps before the battery gets low(but not dead) and almost double that if I disable GPS, 4G,WiFi antenna and other background apps. Standby time also has the same dramatic change depending on background app/antenna use.Other than the battery life, I like this phone. It has a more substantial feel than the Samsungs and was more compact than the Samsungs, though not as compact as the iPhone. Android is good, the interface isn't quite Apple, but it's still rather intuitive and easy to learn. This phone runs quickly, the 5MP camera with flash takes great pictures and I've only had one situation where it locked up and I had to remove the battery to reset. It's only a few months old, so hopefully it continues to be a good phone.Update 6/17/13: This phone began acting slow and buggy after a year. It became worse after upgrading to "Ice Cream Sandwich" Android operating system. I kept the phone up to date, but it just kept getting slower and more buggy. It would turn itself off and even after replacing the battery, nothing changed.As I was recently upgrading to my new iPhone 5 at Best Buy, I asked the mobile phone guy if he had any problems with HTC. He said their phones, the older ones (which this one phone would qualify now) seemed to slow down and age very quickly. I won't buy an HTC again, not any time in the near future.
B005XC6ZZE	I've had this phone for a few months now, so it's about time I typed out my issues with it. Not that it matters, since it's apparently not for sale anymore on Amazon.Pros:It looks coolTons of Android market apps to mess around withLots of spaceNice, brilliant screenDecent cameraCons:Freezes/crashes constantlyTakes a bit of luck for the phone to connect to the Sprint network4G phone doesn't actually connect to the 4G network, everNon-intensive usage will drain a full battery in less than 6 hoursSprint adware is annoying, and uninstallable. NASCAR is stupidKeyboard auto-correct is only useful half of the time, a nuisance the other halfFlat, rectangular shape (generic smartphone shape) is not ergonomic at all, and gives a very uncomfortable phone call experience. Or am I the only person that still actually uses the phone feature on these things?Honestly, I feel that the best part about my phone is the wicked cool Invisible Shield I had installed, and that's not even part of the phone, so... bleh.2/5 Stars because it does a ton of stuff, but none of them particularly well. With the battery as pathetic as it is, this is definitely NOT the phone you'd want to have when your car breaks down out in the middle of nowhere. Reliability is severely lacking from this product.
B005XC6ZZE	I have had this phone for several months.  4-G is not available but still paying for it.  I like the phone but the camera is very senstive and impossible to see graphics in the sun and very little even when shaded.  Other than this I would rate 4 stars.
B005XC6ZZE	This phone is flat out awesome and fast! I am over pleased with my phone. I recommend this phone to anyone that wants a super fast phone that isn't huge and bulky.
B005XC6ZZE	Pros:1. Size. The 4" screen is the right size for me for 1 handed operation.2. Call quality. I'm one of those old fashioned people who make phone calls and I've had no issues with hearing or being heard.3. HTC Sense. I've had other Android phones and didn't get it. Now I do and Sense really makes the phone sing.4. World phone, can use it while I'm travelling out of the country.Cons:1. Sense 3.0, no timeframe on the upgrade to 3.52. Gingerbread, no timeline for upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich. Upgrade timing is a general problem with all Android phones.3. Sprint's 4G tax. I get that Sprint need to pay for their network upgrade but an extra $10 per month almost put me off buying it.Summary: This phone does everything right at a great price.The 2 main things that I need from a phone is that it has great call quality and I can use it with one hand and this phone really delivers.It being a world phone is a huge bonus for me.
B005XC6ZZE	The EVO Design is a long, slim smartphone reminiscent of the original Droid Incredible but longer.  It fits perfectly in my hand, even with a Seidio case on it, and is perfectly sized for one-handed texting.  Having owned an original EVO for just over a year, I immediately noticed this phone seems quicker -- the Sense UI in the EVO never really felt slow, but in the Design it has a more instantaneous feel.  Sense 3.0 is amazing.  If you don't like the ringer, wallpaper, or layout options that HTC has pre-loaded, you can go over to their Beta website and download hundreds more for free. Quite a nice feature.  I  also instantly noticed the additional internal storage, and how you can remove the Sprint crapware that comes pre-installed.  Bravo!The 5 MP camera seems to take better pictures than the 8 MP in the original EVO. I'm not sure what the deal is, but pics taken without the flash are less blurry as well. There are more settings for picture taking, too, but the pics seem better even without any tweaks.  *shrug*The phone feels substantial. Although I'm personally not a fan of how the brushed aluminum in the middle of the back cover looks, there's no denying it adds a durable feel to the phone. I'd prefer if the entire back were made up of the soft-touch plastic that the rest of the back is covered with (it's super grippy).The screen is super. Again, it seems sharper than the original EVO, especially with small text and icons.Seriosuly, this phone is a bargain at $79.99 (upgrade price) currently. I first got a Samsung Conquer for the same price, but after tinkering with one of these bad boys at a local electronics store, I exchanged the Conquer for the EVO Design. If you want a smartphone that is smaller than the huge ones coming out as of late, it's your best option.  As an added benefit, HTC confirmed this week that the Design will definitely get the Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade.So in summary, I'd say if you are a current first-gen EVO owner, you'll most likely love the Design, unless you want a huge-a*s screen that borders on the size of a tablet (read Galaxy S II, upcoming Galaxy Nexus etc.) :)If you want something that fits in your jeans pocket perfectly, with snappy performance, a great camera, nice screen and the industry's best and most customize-able UI, get the EVO Design 4G.  It's an amazing value all around.
B005XC6ZZE	Ive been through 2 of these phones. The software always freezes up (the Operating systems), Constant problems with not sending text messages, And my camera/Flash/videorecorder doesnt work. I think something is busted inside. I have another year untill Im eligable for an upgrade, so I need to get a new phone. Dont get this phone, It also has problems with hanging up on people no matter how close my cheek is to the phone. If I dont lock my phone before I talk it will do wierd things like hang up, add a call, etc. Also It reboots on my while im talking . It takes about 3 minutes for it to reboot. DONT GET THIS PHONE
B005XC6ZZE	I love my phone. I wanted something with all the new features but did not want something big, so this phone fits all my needs. It works great and fits easily in my hand or pocket. it is light and slim, cameras on both sides.
B005XC6ZZE	I have been with Sprint Wireless for 1 month today, after switching from Verizon.  I love my phone (HTC EVO Design 4G).  I should qualify that I love my phone now that it is working.  I had to take it back 6 days after purchasing it because the display kept shutting off 10-15 seconds after I did anything, even though the settings were set to shut off after 5 minutes.  The cell phone reception has been about the same as what we experienced with Verizon, spotty in some areas but OK in most areas.I must say though that the customer service that I have received from Sprint has been abominably poor.  I had to call to have a charge taken off my first bill that I did not authorize.  As of today (2 weeks after I first called and two more calls later), the erroneous charge still shows on my bill and my account shows past due because of it.  I purchased two phones (both the same model) at the same time.  The second phone is now giving the same problem as the first one was before it was replaced, shutting off at very short intervals.  We have taken it back to the Sprint store where we purchased it.  Three different employees in that store (Southcenter Parkway store in Tukwila, WA) have been extremely rude to us.  They refuse to look at the second phone without charging us $35 each time.  Even when they didn't fix the problem, when we take it back they want another $35.  I only paid $99 for the phone in the first place.  Why should I have to repurchase the phone $35 at a time when the phone is only 30 days old since I purchased it.  It has not been dropped or damaged - the display is defective.  It is supposedly under a 1 year warranty from the manufacturer, but the Sprint Store refuses to honor this.  Today, they advised that the phone has a defective motherboard, but they still refuse to fix it unless we pay $35 (in addition to the other two visits where they charged us to reset the phone and it did not fix the problem).  We have asked to speak to a supervisor or manager and one is never available and they will not give us a manager's name to contact later.  I have tried three different times to contact Sprint Customer Service by phone.  All three times, I get to talk to an employee who asks my name and account info.  Then they put me on hold.  In all three cases, I was on hold for over 30 minutes and finally hung up.Sprint does not stand behind the product they sell and they will not honor the manufacturer's warranty.  They make it impossible to speak to anyone at their company about the problem.  I highly recommend that you avoid doing business with this company.  THEY STINK BIG TIME.  :(
B005XC6ZZE	Best phone i have ever had. Looks sleek, handles great. I am a little lost with the whole syncing thing, and am definitely not a fan of how the back camera bumps out (the phone doesn't lay exactly flat). Also, it has terrible battery life (5 hours ??). That said, it is beautiful to look at, handles all my apps great, it's fast and has lot to offer. Well done
B005XC6ZZE	I bought two of these phones as upgrades for our old LG's.  The phones have most of the features I would like, and generally perform well.  I did have an issue with one phone, after almost two months it started to malfunction.  Since the Amazonwireless warranty only covers the first month, I had to go to Sprint to get this addressed.  After some testing they have decided to order me a new phone.  Unfortunately, that costs ~40 dollars more.  I have seen other reviews online reporting similar behavior, so this may be a wider problem.  Looking forward to getting the replacement, and I hope it has no further problems.
B005XC6ZZE	I had the HTC Evo and LOVED it. So when it was time to upgrade, I chose this phone, hoping it would be an "Upgrade" to the Evo. No such luck. I had to get Sprint on the line 3 times to send "Refreshes". It freezes up, it drops calls and the sound fades in and out. I found myself walking around my office saying "Can you hear me now?". I am very unhappy with this phone and am returning it.Now I am not sure what to go to. Probably the iPhone.One Sprint Tech told me 3 towers were down and that was why I was having a problem. Four of my staff members have Sprint and had no connection issues with their phones. Just disappointed.
B005XC6ZZE	I bought an HTC Evo Shift wireless and have had nothing but problems with it.  Most recently, when trying to send text messages, a delete message screen pops up or it will take me all the way to the top of the message.  HTC promised to call me back on a certain date and time, but they did not.  I e-mailed executives at HTC.  In the end, HTC could not fix the problem, because they could not reproduce the errors on their end.HTC sent me a HTC Design phone, and I sent them the Evo Shift back.  When the phone arrived, it would not turn on.  I tried an Evo Shift battery in it, but it wouldn't fit in the phone.  I took the phone to the Sprint Store.  Jeremy T. waited on me.  He could not get the phone to turn on with the battery that came with the design.  He asked a repair technician there, and he said the battery was bad.  Sprint was nice enough to swap out the battery for me.  When I got home, I tried calling people with the phone with the same earpiece I used on the Evo Shift, but people could not hear me.  I will not put the phone to my head, because I don't want the risk of getting a brain tumor.  I contacted HTC.  HTC told me he would send me out a new Design phone.  Then, 2 days later they sent me an e-mail saying he changed their mind and they won't send me out a new phone, because I tried the Shift battery in the Design phone.HTC was very rude.  They told me that they cannot make better phones if they're always trying to fix the defects in my phone.
