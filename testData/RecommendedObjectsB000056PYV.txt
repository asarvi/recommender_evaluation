B001ILQ48W	The ear pieces are larger than typical headphones, so beware if you have a small ear opening.  Other than that, the quality is very good for phone conversations and listening to music on the Samsung Impression.  It seems fairly durable so far.The cord connecting one earphone is longer than the other, to allow the microphone to hang closer to the left shoulder.  The overall cord is adequately long.
B001ILQ48W	Purchased this for my wife's cell phone and it's a very decent hands-free headset for the cost, especially with a baby on her lap.
B001ILQ48W	I purchased these a while ago, and still have all the sets I purchased. I use them on occasion, but not all the time. I have recently purchased the Motorola Wireless Bluetooth headphones, (Model S305,) and I'm so impress with the quality, I will probably never use these headphones again, mainly because they have a wire attached, and the jack on my phone only allows for either a headphone OR a charger, but not both.Nice price - and they do work well if you don't mind the wire!
B001ILQ48W	This is just what my son needed for his phone. He is very happy with it. Uses it every day. Thanks for the speedy delivery.
B001ILQ48W	I'm 6'2" tall and weigh 195 pounds. These things are too big to fit comfortably in my ears. I can't quite get them in, so it always feels like they're falling out. A competing set costs a little more and does not include a microphone, but you can use the phone's mic for that. The sound quality for the competing set is great and the ear plugs fit comfortably in my average sized ears. You could just take the chance that your ear canals are big enough. If you don't need the extra microphone, however, I recommend the Samsung Samsung R610 SCH-R610 Propel I627 SGH-I627 i908 Omnia SGH-i908 T659 SGH-t659 A517 SGH-A517 Black OEM Cell Phone Handsfree AAEP435SBE AAEP485MBE.
B004EVRBIK	I love listening to my Pandora through these speakers.  Wow!  A really good deal and I enjoy listening to my music.  A must have!  Oh!  The speaker phone works really well... It's loud and clear!
B004EVRBIK	Great Product, but its not for the 3G MyTouch Slide. Only for the 3G Mytouch 1st Gen phones....Speakers are great, sound quality is good.
B004EVRBIK	I had one of these for my 3g three years ago, even if I don't have that cell anymore these speakers have taken a beating and played its heart out. When it broke my daughter was sad, so guess what? I ordered another one! It came fast! I love this product. I also use it when I massage it works with various music devices and even laptops. I will probably order another one as a back up or have one in each room.
B004EVRBIK	This was a Christmas gift, so you can imagine our disappointment when it didn't work. I believe more specific details about which phones will work are needed.
B004EVRBIK	Do you have a myTouch 3G? Or a Droid Eris? Or any phone that has that strange looking USB input? This product caters to your misfortune. Not only does it charge your phone, it has speakers that are good. I've never used the mic part of it, but the speakers function really well. My myTouch is over-the-hill at this point and I don't expect it to survive through the winter, but I can't blame the rock dock for it. I played "I Go Hard in the Paint" for 2 hours on repeat in a Vegas hotel room last weekend and no one complained about the sound quality.
B004EVRBIK	I purchased this for the hands free feature.  I didn't realize that the dock was propietary.  It wouldn't accept my phone.
B004EVRBIK	I really LOVE this product for the original MyTouch. It has power and it is really well made. I wish they still had made them for the other various models of MyTouches. I would recommend this product any day.
B004EVRBIK	I love love love this docking station I have been wanting it for a while but it cost tooo much for my budget. I saw the price come down and I ordered it right away. It does not fit my 3g slide. I am really really sad :(
B004VUEO16	I'm not an audiophile. I can't tell you anything about the quality of the sound, other than to say I've never noticed a problem.I like the all-white look of these headphones. I've had them 2 months and they still look nice, although the foam in the ear cups has begun to yellow.It was really important to have in-line volume control, because my coworkers will start talking to me before I have a chance to open up iTunes and click on the pause button. "WAIT WHAT, I DIDN'T HEAR THAT!" With this, I can flick the audio off in half a second.I have had to return headphones before for squeezing my head too tightly. These however are fine once you stretch them out a bit.However, for me there's a limit to how long I can wear any headphones / earbuds, and this is no different. After about 2 hours my head needs to take a break.Are these high end headphones? No. But they are attractive and functional.
B004VUEO16	So far so good, just no carrying case of any sort which seems odd. But the sound seems fine on my ipad
B004VUEO16	Pros: Nice cord, relatively comfortable, stylish.  I really like the braided cloth covered cord, doesn't tangle much.  Headphone jack on the earpiece allows sharing.Cons: Sound is very muddy. Poor bass and poor treble, very midrange-heavy sound.  Seemed to improve with &#34;burn-in&#34; after a couple days, but still not ideal.
B004VUEO16	I needed &#34;in-line&#34; controls for use with an iPod/iPhone, which these had, and I also wanted a strong bass, and these are pretty good in that way (I found better, but for three times the price, and those didn't have the &#34;in-line&#34; controls).
B004VUEO16	Love the sound and quality and what a deal at the price !!As well as very cool looking as well.
B004VUEO16	Its functions described in the information box works great. I love the clean, classy white headphones, which i found to fit my head very well. It was quite comfortable and the sound it blocks out is quite remarkable for a $50 headphone. The sound system is good, nice extras were worth the extra dollars and come in handy. I love my headphones and would buy again!
B004VUEO16	One of my biggest let downs this year....I purchased these headphones based on its growing popularity within Apple's Online Store. I decided to get it on Amazon because it offered the "White" model which I wanted. Upon receiving the package, I was excited about adding another headphone to my collection. At this price point, I was hoping for a pair that I can wear casually, meanwhile keeping my Audio Technica ATH-M50 and Dr. Dre Beats at home for other purposes.On the first try, I wanted to log on Amazon right away and give it 2-3 stars, but I decided to wear it for a couple weeks as well as run some unbiased experiments to give it a better feedback. Turns out, there was nothing that can justify this as a better pair of headphones than its competitors.I compared this to a $130 pair of ATH-M50s, $20 pair of Apple Earphones, and another pair of headphones. Final conclusion? In terms of performance, it gives a clear, colorful sound which allows you to hear both the high/low levels. However, I did expect more. When you compare these to Apple's stock OEM earphones, the quality is just about the same. Urbanears products however gives with these earpads that really do keep sound out. This helps. For a pair of $50-60 headphones, I think this is average but not good enough for me to not want to reach $30-40 more to get a pair of Sony's or cheaper Audio Technica's.Let's chat about comfort which destroyed the excitement for me. It's just too damn tight. I think I have an average size head (maybe slightly bigger?). Either way I've had several folks, all smaller than me, try on the headphones. Even when you have the headphones around your neck, it feels like the headphone is trying to actively strangle you to death. This easily slapped a star and a half off this product for me (the other half a star comes from the disappointment in terms of performance, okay but not good enough).The product was beautifully packaged and I really like the way Urbanears is going. If the headphones fit better, I would've given it 4 stars but I can't see myself wearing these much in the future. I'm slightly disappointed but think these will fit many people in terms of performance and expectation for its price range. I've worn them the past 5 minutes while writing this review and already my ears are beginning to hurt. I do hope I can come back a couple months from now and add a star but for now, the discomfort and mediocre performance will keep it at a 3.
B004VUEO16	Bought for my daughter. Didn't want to spend the money on beats, as she isn't an audiophile. But they looked nice, had the remote mic and volume controls. WOW! They are nice. My son has Beats and says these are just as good. He said he might like them even better!
B004VUEO16	I uses these quite a lot and love them. The fit is good and the sound is very full and rich. The overall feel of the headphones is exceptional as it just feels like quality manufacturing. This feeling includes the cable which is cloth covered so does not tangle. Overall I have the intent to look at other products from this company.
B004VUEO16	These are simply amazing headphones. they are extremely durable, even when folded up. I've shoved them in my backpack dozens of times, and they're completely fine. The remote works better than those of the Apple earbuds, and is much more comfortable and easier to press. Noise cancellation is great and the ear cushions are very comfortable. Sound quality is absolutely spectacular. You can turn them up realllllly loud and still have it not hurt because they're over-the-ear. This results in great sound balance because you don't get cymbal and treble crashes directly in your ear canal. As far as bass goes, these are the best headphones in their class and price range. When turned up to max volume they can even be used as around-the-neck speakers :p  If you're looking for over-the-ear, great sound quality, durability, and surprising affordability, then look no further than Urbanears Plattan. Everything else is either crappy, or severely overpriced.
