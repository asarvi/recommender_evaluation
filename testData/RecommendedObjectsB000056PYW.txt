B003X8P39O	I bought this for my husband who needed a hands-free headset, because he drives a commercial truck (not over-the-road). Since he didn't want a blue tooth and doesn't actually talk on the phone that much while driving, this is perfect for his needs. When he calls me, he says he can hear me as if I were in the same room with him; and I can hear him just fine, even over the engine noise. Another great product from Samsung.
B003X8P39O	The wired headset that originally came with my phone fell apart, so I looked to Amazon for a replacement.  These headphones are so far superior to what I had before that I cannot get over the improvement.  This headset has a plug for each ear and the sound is loud and clear.  Strongly recommend the equipment and the vendor who delivered a great price and rapid shipment.
B003X8P39O	sound is decent, i even listen to music with them. people i call can hear me quite well. my only beef is the hard ear buds, they bounce out of my ears when running.
B003X8P39O	The headphones were just as described and work perfectly. The shipping was right on time. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B003X8P39O	Bought this years ago when touch screen basic phones started to come out, Really liked my solstice and this allowed me to hold private conversations with out having to hold the phone up to my ear, so I could do chores or whatever required two hands at the time. Great for Samsung Solstice, like the fist one that came out.
B003X8P39O	I would give this handset five stars if it had two components more:1. A clip to fix the cord on a dress (which most of headsets do have). I was lucky to keep one from my old headset.2. It would be nice to have ear-hooks that some headsets have. This small pieces of plastic would cost less than a centbut they would add a lot of convenience making the head set truly hands-free.Otherwise than that this headset is very good.
B005IUGSXU	Multiple versions for IPad2.  This of course, doesn't fit my 2012 iPad2. Not an expensive mistake but a huge time delay.  Should probably be part of the Digitizer Kit (you're likely to need 1).
B005IUGSXU	The cable by itself worked flawlessly, frankly honest the apple company are leeches, they will nail their fangs into your wallet as soon as they have a chance, I didn't even dare to ask how much would they charge to. Change this cable to avoid a heart attack so I decided to give this cable a try, a few observations :Handle this cable with a lot of care because they are really fragile (nothing different than the apple one)The adhesive didn't work quite well, gave me a bit of issuesApple, of course made it hard, you'll have to twist it and bend it, I recommend to order two, apple seems to make it hard purposely but with patience and care to replace it, worked for me without any issue and bringing my ipad2 back to life
B005IUGSXU	Install was straight forward. Could use better adhesive strips to complete, used a bit of glue to install. But would recommend.
B005IUGSXU	I bought this on July but didn't put it in until yesterday, everything works great except the smart cover magnetic switch, I was very careful, the first time I replaced a screen I ruined the delicate cable, this time I was ultra careful, but no luck.the price was great but but you have to remove the screen to replace this cable.
B005IUGSXU	It was just what the site advertised on photo & specification. Plenty of others to choices from if the first one dozen't fit the bill ..I like that!
B005IUGSXU	repaired broken ipad by myself. BE very careful as with all electronics. I had to super glue the power button onto the mount as the adhesive wouldn't hold well enough.
B005IUGSXU	Awesome product. Please make sure to GET TWO! GET TWO OF THEM. Just so you see that it says to get two. The product works perfect but you'll never know if you get a defective one in a bunch. Which is what happened to me. First time I went to replace the ribbon I got all the way up to the power button after an hour, and the button doesn't click. But thank god I ordered two the other one worked perfect. Also go to walmart or order some super glue gel. If the adhesive doesn't stick we'll it works great to use. Use a needle and put a tiny bit on. But this product works perfect! I didn't find the cable too fragile at all. I found the pale one to rip easier then this one. Shipping was fast. Ordered Thursday got on Tuesday. Love it! Hope this helps.
B005IUGSXU	I had to buy this because I cut the other one replacing the digitizer on my IPad2.  It worked great and I bought 2 of them just in case I messd up one of them.  Good quality worked great.  I didn't need 2 but now should i break another one, I'm all set.Highly recommended.
B005IUGSXU	Mute switch does not work. The cable was installed correctly the buttons works flawlessly however when I tested out the mute switch nothing happens. Perhaps I got a bad one.  Now I have to open the ipad again and install the second cable i got form them. That's a lot of work. Once I get around to doing it, I'll update this review.
B005IUGSXU	Lots of good videos out there to help with pulling out your old cable and installing this.  Watch them a couple of times if this is your first time replacing this cable because it's a lot trickier to replace than other cables in the iPad (iPad2 in my case).  My recommendation is to really pay attention to how everything is oriented when you pull your old cable out.  There is one right way to put everything back together, pay attention to details and you'll be OK.
B005IUGSXU	great item comes as described. the overall replacement was little scary and no a easy as the video. but this works great.
B006LPTDMY	I have a Droid and this did not work at all with it.  Made a high pitch whine so could not hear other party or be heard by other party.  Had to return the thing.
B006LPTDMY	I was excited to get this product. I can only hear callers, they cannot hear me.  Pretty much useless. Contacted company, they just said they have no trouble with phones there. Really!!!!!
B006LPTDMY	i have a home based business and prefer the handset over my mobile.my mobile serves as my personal/business line and i find the handset more convenient.* good volume* good sound* good price
B006LPTDMY	Very pleased. This accessory worked out of the box I have a Samsung Galaxy paired and love it.Even tho it's inexpensive i think it should last.
B006LPTDMY	With multiple Skype calls going on in the office frustration tend to rise at times with so many conversations taking place in the same location it can be next to impossible at times not to over ride the person next you or the other way around (most times) so to avoid conflict i thought i would do my part and give this option a try.The phone reacts exactly like i'd hoped having clear signal speaking and listening like a standard hard line phone with no dropped calls or interference on either end.
B006LPTDMY	The phone arrived as promised, on time and undamaged.Hardly an investment at the price, in any case worth recommending. Ultra easy workable design, ample sound produced.
