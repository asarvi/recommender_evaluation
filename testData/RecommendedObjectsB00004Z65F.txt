B0026NNGZK	never really had a chance to use that tried it once in my laptop but i don't think it works for that. I am deployed so i skype a lot and was trying to see if it would be loader for the other person to hear. didn't work, but it was worth a try!Mahalo
B0026NNGZK	I bought this because I only have a 2nd gen iPod Touch w/no mic, and I like to have it handy when I'm songwriting/jamming so I don't forget anything I come up with. This mic is clear, sensitive, and is easy to use. Just don't put it right next to the sound source if you're rocking out or shouting or something, it'll clip.Oh, and the little plastic keychain loop broke off mine pretty quickly. But for $2 I'm really not gonna care too much.
B0026NNGZK	Works great. Small and portable. Easy to stow within an ipod case. Just have to get used to removing it to listen.
B0026NNGZK	I ordered this to use on textfree with voice and Skype. It does not work for ether because it goes into the headphone jack so you can not hear the other person or any other sound on the iThing. If you are buying this as a cheep headset think again. It would be find for recording your voice though, you will just have to pull it out to listen. This is a smarter buy because you plug your headphones into the microphone.New White Color Headset Hands Free 3.5mm Adapter + Microphone for Apple iPod Touch iTouch 1 2 3 iPhone 2 3g 3gS
B0026NNGZK	I was skeptical if this tiny mic would perform well. After making a few tests, I was nothing less than amazed at the quality of this little thing. It really produces quite an astonishing sound either up close or recording lectures. It does however pick up ALL room noise. So if you're recording yourself or others speaking, you should record in a fairly quiet room, maybe one with carpeting. The only thing I find a little unfortunate is that it does not have a input volume control. So recording loud live music could easily distort. But, for the money and the results, it's well worth it. I wish someone would come out with an adapter for the iPod Touch 2G so we can plug a regular microphone in and adjust input volume.
B0026NNGZK	This mic worked very well and is so cool. only downside is that you have to remove it to hear sound.
B0026NNGZK	it was fast shipping the only problem i found with it is you have to take the microphone out to hear the recording other then that it works great
B0026NNGZK	Comes in real handy when using ipod touch. I use it to record things and is pretty decent on picking up sounds.
B0026NNGZK	This microphone works great and is a steal for under a dollar. Have to pay for shipping, though, so if you are going to buy one, buy a few instead. I bought my first for over $10, lost it after a few weeks (they are really small. tie a string or something to the cap) and had to buy another. I actually bought my replacement for $3 or so with free shipping, but assuming $5 for shipping (as per another reviewer), it would make a lot more sense to pay $8 for 3 than $6 for one.
B0026NNGZK	Purchased the little pill-cap for my iPod touch to record class lectures and meetings I didn't want to take notes at.  Good quality mike for such a small little piece.  I had to put it on a tiny lanyard because it literally looks like a pill when you close it up ---- and I've almost lost it a few times!  But as far as its size, convenience and performance, its great for what I use it for.
B0026NNGZK	The product is cheap and excellent,  the reception is perfect just keep it in a sefe place because is to small  and you canlose it
B0026NNGZK	It stated that it was compatible with the touch, however, it turns off the speaker. The mic works ok, but does not work with app that you need to hear also. So it works with the voice memo app, and to hear it play back you will have to remove it from your iPod.
B0026NNGZK	Yes Got this for my granddaughter she was pleased.Of course I didn't know what she was talking about.It was for her I pod.
B0026NNGZK	Perfect. This is a really convenient microphone with good quality for doing voice recordings in meetings, which is what I use it for. It's tiny size makes it more useable than most I've used, and it's simple to sue on my iPods - just plug it in and record using the iPod inbuilt software.
B0026NNGZK	Paid about 5 dollars to ship a 71 cent item weighing less that 2 ounces.I could put (2) 44 cent stamps on a bubble wrap envelope and it would arrive anywhere in the US,including Alaska and Hawaii faster than the 11 days E-Force city states it will take to arrive.Shipping Rip Off
B0026NNGZK	Description and picture specifies the finish as RUBBER BLACK but they sent shiny plastic black, nowhere near as nice of a finish.  When I asked them about this they said they only have one type of black.  The mic itself is sensitive and sounds good.
B002JCBKLU	I really wanted a mono headset for my Blackberry so was happy to find this one at Amazon.  However, the headset didn't work very well with my Blackberry.  50% of the time the caller could hear me but I couldn't hear them.  It comes with several ear bud sizes - which was a nice feature - but doesn't do me much good when I can't hear the caller. I tossed this one in the trash and went back to using the stereo headset that came with my phone.  I give it 2 stars for the price and the variety of ear buds.  You might get lucky and have this headset work 100% of the time for you.
B002JCBKLU	This item fits in your ear nice and has good sound quality. Great value for the price. I would definitely recommend it.
B002JCBKLU	I found the sound quality to be much better than my bluetooth headset, but the piece wouldn't stay in my ear. I tried the different sizes sent with the headset but found that the piece would fall out after a few minutes of use. Great for short phone calls but not long conversations.
B002JCBKLU	I purchased this headset to be used with my blackberry curve. It works well enough as a headset and I would rate the wound quality on both ends as average (about the same as the standard headset that came with my phone). My complaints are more on the interface and experience rather than sound.First, the fit was not great. I love in-ear headsets and have been using different style in-ear headsets and headphones for many years. This is the principle reason that I purchased this headset for my phone. That said, the angle of the headset insert and bulk of the speaker box were such that I had some difficulty getting a good fit. It would insert into the ear canal fine, but had trouble staying in place. I tried different sized ear tips to no avail.Also, the ear tips have a tendency to fall off this headset. As you may know, this is common for in-ear style headset and headphones, but from my experience it was excessive with this headset. I lost several ear tips in a short while using these. Luckily I  have several spare ear tips and was able to use some of these otherwise that headset would have been useless within a couple days.Lastly, the cord is very thin. I did not get the sense it was particularly fragile, but it was very textured and had a tendency to snag on everything. I use my headset in the car a lot and it was constantly catching on my steering wheel, hand brake, arms, clothes, you name it. And every time it got snapped it popped off my ear.Summary: this headset works, I just prefer a different aesthetic.
B002JCBKLU	Very convenient and much better than the wireless Bluetooth headsets. Since for those we have to charge and carrying the chargers all the time too.
B0040WPVSU	good ear piece.
B0040WPVSU	I use this with my GU295.  It works perfectly.Pros - does everything you expect, exactly as you expect it.  Doesn't run out of battery or suffer from ANY interference.  Never unexpectedly connected, like bluetooth can be.  Great for driving in a noisy car at highway speeds with the AC blasting and kids talking in the back seat.Cons - it has a cord.  Not good for talking to grandma with a baby in your arms.  Gets tangled.
B0040WPVSU	I don't use this product because it's never convenient to use. Till I find it, hook it on my ear, get it plugged in, I'm usually finished with my phone conversation. Prefer to just put people on speaker if I can.  If not, I talk to them on the phone the old-fashioned way.
B0040WPVSU	This headset is better than what you'd expect for $6.  It doesn't fit my ear very well and I had to attach a rubber band to make it stay on.  But it works.  I have an LG Vu Plus GR700 phone and its bluetooth tranceiver is very poor.  I've tried pairing it with expensive, high quality bluetooth ear pieces but people constantly complain they cannot hear my voice.  So I abandoned bluetooth and went to a wired headset. Unfortunately, the GR700 has no dedicated headset jack, only a micro USB port, so I needed a headset with a micro USB jack and those are quite rare.  This headset has a micro USB jack and now people can hear me.
B0040WPVSU	sound quality is good; good price; I like the one ear only, allowing me to multi-task.difficult to twist and get a good fit on ear.
B006LPNA9Q	This is a mid-century telephone handset redesigned and sleeked out in several hot colors and coated with silky smooth silicone so that it is ultra-comfortable to hold. At the end of its springy coiled cord is a 3.5mm jack that fits the iPhone and several other mobile phones. No more holding the mobile phone up to your face, just place it on your desk pick up the handset and think 1960! As a bonus, anyone who is worried about possible radiation from mobile phones can breathe a sigh of relief. I think that design wise, this handset is gorgeous. The sound quality is superb and the looks you'll get from others will be priceless. I'm having great time, reminiscing with this. I am sure you will as well!
B006LPNA9Q	I got this item after buying one from another company that did not work. So far so good. Clear reception when I call some one or when the call  me. Color is bright but I like it. not much else to say since it is easy to use plug i ino your cellphone's headphone jack.
B006LPNA9Q	This handset is fun and easy to use, impeccable upon delivery, and was delivered within two days of purchase. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase and I use it all the time in phone calls, FaceTime, and more.
B006LPNA9Q	I was worried because it was so inexpensive - but the sound is great - I can hear them and they can hear me and no more neck ache from trying to hold a too small phone between my ear and shoulder.This has made life and conversations with the kids so much better!
B006LPNA9Q	I purchased this item to make lengthy cellphone conversations more comfortable, and so it is obvious when I am talking on the phone. The concept of the Pop Phone has potential, this product comes up short for two reasons:  Priamarily because this sound quality is poor.  I had listeners ask me if I was talking on a speaker phone because the sound was echoing.  Secondarily the cord is too short to place the cellphone on a desk and hold the handset to one's ear. I no longer use my Pop Phone.
B006LPTDMY	I have a Droid and this did not work at all with it.  Made a high pitch whine so could not hear other party or be heard by other party.  Had to return the thing.
B006LPTDMY	I was excited to get this product. I can only hear callers, they cannot hear me.  Pretty much useless. Contacted company, they just said they have no trouble with phones there. Really!!!!!
B006LPTDMY	i have a home based business and prefer the handset over my mobile.my mobile serves as my personal/business line and i find the handset more convenient.* good volume* good sound* good price
B006LPTDMY	Very pleased. This accessory worked out of the box I have a Samsung Galaxy paired and love it.Even tho it's inexpensive i think it should last.
B006LPTDMY	With multiple Skype calls going on in the office frustration tend to rise at times with so many conversations taking place in the same location it can be next to impossible at times not to over ride the person next you or the other way around (most times) so to avoid conflict i thought i would do my part and give this option a try.The phone reacts exactly like i'd hoped having clear signal speaking and listening like a standard hard line phone with no dropped calls or interference on either end.
B006LPTDMY	The phone arrived as promised, on time and undamaged.Hardly an investment at the price, in any case worth recommending. Ultra easy workable design, ample sound produced.
