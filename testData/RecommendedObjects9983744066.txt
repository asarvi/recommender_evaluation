B0008ESG8G	My second one.  Works with my Blackberry, BT Headset, and other cell phone.  Only reason I did not give it five stars, was due to over time the stress of pulling it to get it to retract caused it to wear the cord out on one side.  With that said, the first lasted 2 yrs.
B0008ESG8G	These are great.  I carry about 5 different cables in a small bag in my briefcase.  I travel every week and use these cables constantly.  I LOVE them, they have eliminated all the frustrating tangles trying to plug stuff in.  I use this to charge my BT headset and PDA/phone plus it gives a trickle charge to my Kindle.
B0008ESG8G	With more and more devices allowing for mini-usb charging and synching... this product is great.
B0008ESG8G	It wasn't clear (at least to me) from the write-up in Amazon that the cord isn't thick enough to supply power to a USB hard drive.  Says so right on the package, but too late.  So BEWARE if you were hoping to use this cord with an external USB drive (as I was)
B0008ESG8G	Works with my usb 2.0 MP3 player (rio forge sport) and my garmin etrex vista color GPS.
B0008ESG8G	I ordered the Zip-Linq USB 2.0 A to Mini5 because it is five-pin model that will supply power to gadgets like cell phones and it pulls out to 48", longer than many others.There are probably only one or two factories in the world that produce these items, with distributors private labeling them. Even if so, the Zip-Linq unit appears better made than many others. This one even has a loop for a keychain or ring.These cables are great for anyone who travels or is on the go. No tangles, no excess space requirements. Very convenient gadget at a reasonable price.Jerry
B0008ESG8G	Works great! I just wish it was a tad bit longer, maybe 6 inches. You only get about 2 feet of cord. That is almost too short from my cpu on the floor to the table top above.
B0008ESG8G	Excellent cable. Retractor works like a charm. No needing to pull all the way out to make it retract. I had to replace the cable for the speakers for my netbook and bought this. Definitely better quality sound because of this cable. The gold plating is real and they are high quality. Great buy!
B0008ESG8G	There's definitely nothing about this product that warrants the selling price of $9.98 each--far, far from it. The casing looks and feels chintzy: even the little, circular, plastic, logo plaque is blurry and is stuck on the casing off-center; dirty, excess glue remains. I do want to point out, however, that the seller responded very promptly and exceptionally courteously to my complaint to Amazon about the low quality, and that one cable was missing from the shipment (I ordered two).
B0008ESG8G	What Flash76 said is exactly correct. This cable will NOT supply sufficient power to more demanding devices such as external drives. It works fine with my older MP3 player however ... and does appear to be handing both data and power to the player adequately.Though the Amazon description does not note this fact, the manufacturer DOES do so right on the back of the back of the product packaging, stating:"NOTE: Because of wire size limitations, External drives must be self powerd." [sic]I'm no electrical engineer, that's for sure, but I suppose you just need a larger, more 'regular' gauge cable to 'carry' sufficient quantity of power back to the more demanding devices. When using such a cable with my external drive, I have no problem.But when using these retractables with the external drive, the power light comes on, then the platters can be heard click-click-clicking away, trying to start up a spin unsuccessfully. Eventually, I get a "device not recognized" message from Windows (since it can't fire up to send the drivers downline).I bought three of these retractables and also I have two external drives, and no matter how I pair them, I get the same result. Regular gauge OK -- these retractables, not enough power.Other than that, these Zip-Linqs work well and are of good construction. They retract and extract easily.So for MP3 players, cameras, cell phones, etc., these retractables are probably going to do you just fine.Shame they don't make the same kind of device in the larger gauge for those that want them for travel/portable/temporary use to power up larger devices.I am going to use this12-inch 'Shortys' cable from Ziotekfor now. Wish it were a bit longer, though, maybe 18-inches.
B0009HHSI6	I was a little concerned because these sync cords tend to be finicky, and reviews on some of them talk about the item not being as pictured. In this case, it is perfect. It charges. It syncs. It has a button. And since Treos are going the way of the do-do bird, I am going to order one more cable just in case I can't get them soon.
B0009HHSI6	The Palm Treo OEM Data Cable works great for syncing your palm products to Outlook and backing up contacts and files.  The product has a small button the on the palm connector that allows you to connect via usb at one and connect your palm hit the button and all your data is backed up.  The Palm Desktop software must be installed on your computer and Active Sync is a free download for Windows XP, 2000 and media manager for Windows Vista and Windows 7.  Overall great product.
B0009HHSI6	Just had to put something in here, I saw the review saying there was no sync button but really only needed this cable for charging and SD card access.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the cable has a sync button built into the cable.
B0009HHSI6	This product is missing the button to allow you to start a hot sync operation.
B0009HHSI6	what started off as a good deal ended up being a mistake.within 2 weeks there were only three pins left. good luck making a connection!
B0009HHSI6	For the unsatisfied customers, I wonder if they purchased from a different vendor? I purchased my product from The OEM Shop, meaning they sell only Original Equipment Manufacture products. Since there are no identifying marks on either the new part or the original, I cannot verify this for sure, but I have no reason to doubt it. Looks and functions exactly like my original, and I know that I will have trouble telling them apart unless I mark one of them in some manner.I bought this as an extra for use with my LifeDrive. Like my original, this product has a sync button, a place to plug in the charger, and both the charger and the sync button work just fine. The cord length is the same. The Sync button is even a little nicer - it clicks instead of just pushing down.re: the vendor, The OEM Store - Shipping was INCREDIBLY fast - shipped the next day, arrived 2 days later. The price was incredible, and the shipping cost is 'round about what I would expect to pay if I shipped a similar item myself.
B0009HHSI6	After about 2 weeks the car charger no longer fits snugly into the phone and slips out while the phone is charging. The home charger is working fine.
B0009HHSI6	I dislike systems with proprietary cables but sometimes you have to deal with it. This allows me to continue using my Treo that I don't want to replace.
B000F6UT6Y	This is easily the best penny I ever spent
B000F6UT6Y	My order arrived in excellent shape as well as the quickly shipping. The cable works great and is easy to use and keep. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B000F6UT6Y	I ordered a few of these to use at home and in my office at work. They work great, they're cheap and do what they're suppose to. If you want one, buy it.
B000F6UT6Y	It charges and syncs my phone(s) just fine, but after about a month of use it wouldn't retract anymore. Wasn't honestly expecting it to work for that long for the price. Decent enough if you need to save space and organize your cords, but otherwise I'd recommend a regular sync cable.
B000F6UT6Y	There is something about the USB connecter that makes the Garmin think it's connected to a computer and makes it go into sync mode... and therefor unusable as a car adapter. It does however allow my Garmin to sync quite easily to my computer ;->
B000F6UT6Y	Very compatible.h g f gvh h h gvh j j j jbgbfvv f h h j mbjbf f f f
B000F6UT6Y	You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract.  The wire is very thin, so I'm thinking it will not last long.
B00448PDRY	The cable ordered works well with the new Nokia C 300. I am happy with the purchase and it arrived in a very timely manner.
B00448PDRY	Cable worked great.  Wanted to down load pictures from phone to my computer and this worked great.  I was able to get the pictures I wanted from my phone to the computer and then put some on Facebook.
B00448PDRY	Item arrived sooner than expected and allowed me to download photos from my cellphone to my PC. Price was very reasonable
B00448PDRY	The cord was just perfect. I didn't like the phone and eventually got rid of it for a more up to date Android. As far as the cord, it was just great.
B00448PDRY	This USB cable worked well with my Nokia C3-00 cell phone.  Of course, I had to download Nokia Suite to transfer the data.
B004IAKKFS	I like having a longer cord to use in the car with my other devices that speak to my phone via bluetooth.
B004IAKKFS	On time and best of it service. if you buy this in store it would cost double but it came on door steps and came with no additional cost. works perfect.
B004IAKKFS	I loved the price of this cable. I went to radioshack and they wanted 30 bucks for this cable, but Amazon saved my butt.It came within 3 days (weekend + monday)The cable is very short though... So if youre looking for something with a decent length, you might wanna consider something else.Works great though for just pluggin in my phone into my laptop!Worth the price!
B004IAKKFS	I ordered two of these, and both have failed. One was bad out the gate, and the other failed within a year. Poor quality.  I advise a different brand.
B004IAKKFS	We have three cables we use around the house for charging our phones, syncing to computers, etc.  I also have a charger cable in the car.  Inevitably though, I'll arrive at work, look at my phone, see 20% battery left and now I have no way to charge it.  I use my phone extensively at work and realized I needed another cable.  I shopped for one locally and the least expensive I found was $9.99.  When I saw the under $3 price with free delivery on this sync and charge cable I immediately ordered one.  It is exactly like the cable that came with the Atrix and Atrix 2 4G phones we own.  Works great and I keep it in my briefcase to plug into my laptop dock at work to recharge my phone.  Great buy!
