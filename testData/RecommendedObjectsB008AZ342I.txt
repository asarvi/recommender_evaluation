B000A0LEBO	This works really well for long car rides and road trips where you dont want to drain your battery.  It also works for our camera, which my dad purchased off the internet so it didnt come with a wall or car charger.
B000A0LEBO	My husband and I go on many rode trips throughout the year and this little gadget have come in very handy especially when the portable GPS was running low on battery.  We do not leave home w/out it.
B000A0LEBO	I bought this item thinking I could use it to charge up my phone.  Digital rights management has gone too far.  My phone will not charge because this is not an official charger.  It said this on my phone the first time I tried to charge it from my car outlet.  This is total BS.  If your a Verizon cell phone user it may be a good idea to avoid this product and Verizon in general.  Talking to my friends about this in more detail I have come to discover that Verizon does not believe in open formats and puts the clamp down on its customers options. AKA you have to use Verizon products with its phones and no third party vendors.  I will not be renewing with Verizon because I believe the customer knows best and I should be allowed to use MY phone with competing products.  At least SDmicro transflash memory from scan disk works in my phone. Otherwise, this is super product as long as your phone isnt being controled by greedy B*st*rd wimps.
B000A0LEBO	The cable and its take-up reel are serviceable but look flimsy. My reel does not apply enough tension; compare with the previous review. The adapter works fine with Garmin 60Csx GPS. Worth the price.
B000A0LEBO	My order shipped and arrived quickly.  As another reviewer mentioned, the color of the cigarette charger portion is white, not black as pictured.  I would have preferred everything be the same color, but it is not too big a deal.  I received more than the elements pictures; in addition to the charger, USB with retractable cord, and two adapters, I also received a variety of other adapters compatible with various models of cell phone, mp3, etc.  Basically, I can charge anything I can think of, from my cell phone, to my camera, and everything in between.
B000A0LEBO	I recieved more then I imagine. The color is white and not black and I liked it. Just next time please let me know BEFORE the right color. Thanks.
B000A0LEBO	there are not many things that you can do wrong when designing such a simple device, but this little things still has a major flaw:the roll that automatically pulls in the cable has a very low threshold so it always pulls in the cable. the force is so strong that it even gets pulled out of the cigarette lighter. kind of annoying when driving.putting a knot in the cable fixes the problem.
B000A0LEBO	This charger works very well for my 5.5 gen video iPod (USB), but it doesn't work at all to charge my Motorola V365. It's not the cables or the adapters, because they work fine to carge/connect my Moto when plugged into my Mac.  It seems that the charger itself is the incompatible component.
B000A0LEBO	Products work great and come in handy when on the go.I've had these for I'd say 2 years if not 3 and use them all the time for my ipod!
B000A0LEBO	This item is just great.  I don't have a USB port in my "old" car and this works wonderfully.  Now, I can listen to my stuff while driving and my family can do the same.  Great on long trips and saves time charging or accidentally forgetting the AC charger in the hotel .... great item for charging the electronic items and adapting.
B000A0LEBO	Perfect little car charger even though I am not using the adapters I'm sure they would come in handy for others or for me in the future good quality and working fine!
B000A0LEBO	The Philips G2G202 Universal Car Charger comes with a cigarette outlet adapter, a USB cord, and 2 USB plugs to charge devices with a standard USB plug, mini 5 and min 4 plugs. The adapter has a blue light on it that illuminates when connected, so you will always know when the unit is operating. The average price for this charger is about $15 without the shipping if purchased online.The reason why I bought this charger, is for when I'm going to an investigation, and need to charge small pieces of equipment that have rechargeable batteries and a USB plug. I keep this is my cars glove compartment in case I forget a charging cord. You can easily use this adapter to charge electronics. The great thing about this charger is you can either use it in a car, or with a computer that has a USB port.The USB can be attached to a port, as well as both the Mini A and B USB plugs. However, I generally use the cord and the plug attached together. If you choose to only use the plug, it's too short to charge a piece of equipment. It can be done, but I normally don't. The only thing I wish had been improved on the overall product is for Philips to have included more types of plugs to attach.
B000A0LEBO	I use this to charge my ETEN M700 cellphone with GPS while driving (GPS eats up the battery very fast). It is powerful enough to keep it well-charged throughout the trip. The retractable cord is very convenient because there is less wire mess (spouse friendly) and you can use it to charge electronics in the back seat also without the fear of snagging the wire.It can charge many sorts of devices- camera/camcorders, cellphones/blackberries, MP3 players that use a USB or firewire (small port) charging. The charger is very portable. Great build quality and functionality.
B000HD4MZO	so far so good, just what i ordered. my previous one i ordered had broken during a power outage, i went to car to charge phone, and it broke.
B000HD4MZO	It was just what I ordered and came in before the "due date" in the mail.  I have no trouble with this product.
B000HD4MZO	i dont know what i would do without this charger. i sometimes forget to charge my phone at home so this comes in handy.
B000HD4MZO	This item did not fit in the cigarette lighter in my car. It keeps sliding out. I have to adjust it until it lays just right and then not touch it all so that it does not pop back out. It did however fit in the lighter in an older model truck. The car is 2000 and the truck is 1992.
B000HD4MZO	Works just like the charger the cell phone store wanted almost $20 for.  Thanks.
B000HD4MZO	I am very pleased with the purchase of this item.  It cost only 25% of what u would pay in the store but works as good as any other car charger. Highly recommended if u want to charge your cell phone while driving.
B000HD4MZO	They did not send the correct charger. It will not work with my phone and I don't fell like contacting them because it's not worth the effort.
B000HD4MZO	It is inexpensive. It works. It should not be used in a bathtub. That is all that needs to be said.
B000HD4MZO	Bought this for my mom who didn't want to pay $30 for the charger at the ATT store.  When she plugged in the AC charger the first time, it blew a fuse and powered down her computer.  Due to this experience, she did not want to even plug in this car charger and risk a problem with her car.  We learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.  For this type of item, you're better off going to the Samsung website and using an online coupon from retailmenot or a similar site.
B000HD4MZO	It works which all you can ever ask for this product. It works and it is cheaper then anything you can find in a store which hits you for $29.99 for just about any accessory it seems.
B000HD4MZO	Don't buy your cell accessories from the dealer when you can get them for a fraction of the price. Works perfectly!
B000HD4MZO	It arrived on itme.  It does the job well.  The price is right. You can't ask for more,  Fully satisfied.
B001IUVJHO	Love it
B001IUVJHO	This little device seemed a great idea in concept - I only have 1 12V outlet in my car and was pretty sick of switching Sirius and ipod plugs over all the time, so I bought this. The packaging was very cheap, basic and in broken English. The item itself felt extremely cheap and flimsy.However it worked just fine - right up until I plugged in my 12V air compressor to top up the air in one of my tires. It worked for a few minutes then cut out. When I stuck my head back in the car, a cloud of melted plastic smoke filled the car, and the device had visibly melted in places. On top of this, it had blown the fuse to my 12V outlet, which had to be replaced. This item was disposed of in W@LMART'S parking lot right after I bought a new fuse.The price can't be beaten, but it may result in death...
B001IUVJHO	I bought this to try and aid in the utilization of my gps. My experiment didn't work too well. But, the device works perfectly fine. I especially like the fact that it's a simplified design.
B001IUVJHO	Everything they said it was works great so far I have had it for about a month and use it everyday. Thank you so much!
B001IUVJHO	The damn thing has already broken apart on me! How do i report a defect?
B001IUVJHO	I personally have not had any issues with this dual charger. I use it for my phone and FM Transmitter and have not had any issues.
B001IUVJHO	Works well. I would recommend that when you use it, wait for your car to start and be running before you plug it in. The sudden overvoltage from starting the car can cause it to fail.
B001IUVJHO	We have so many gadgets that need charged as we travel, and this allows us to charge more than one.
B001IUVJHO	I am giving 1 star because its not going fully inside my car's charging outlet because of its design plus my car's design so pl check your car's charging outlet design before you buy this as this is surely not universal.
B001IUVJHO	Just got this item today and so far so good.  No complaints.  Love it and the fact that three or four people can all charge at the same time makes it even better.
B00313UOZY	My family misplaced another charger..after a couple of weeks I had to buy a new one. Not exactly a quality product...but does exactly what I need it for...charge the phone for a couple of bucks...
B00313UOZY	I thought this phone was an unlocked that I could use for att but my sim card would not fit so back it wentIt was a nice phone though
B00313UOZY	I used it and its been working great for me ever since will be buying for sure in the future. Thanks again....
B00313UOZY	I bought this charger along with an OEM battery for my Nokia 2720 phone.I have no complaints at all with either product,and am more than happy with the seller ,Mobility1.Some times you don't know what you are going to get with some of the sellers of cell phones and accessories on Amazon,but I have had no problems with either one of the products.
B00313UOZY	Failed after 1 month. Red light is on when plugged into active 12 volt socket but no longer charges the Nokia phone. Other AC chargers work fine.
B00313UOZY	I bought this for my friend...It came very fast and seems to work as stated....only used it once so far....
B00313UOZY	I wish the cord was a tad longer and a bit more flexible for those times I need to use the phone as it is being charged. Knowing what I now know, I would still purchase it.
B00313UOZY	This item absolutely does not work on a Nokia 2720. The input connector to the phone is way too big.
B00313UOZY	Works great. Great price. It arrived in a reasonable time fro0m when it was shipped.  Should have ordered another one if I had known it was that cheap!
B003A051BU	Great value for Samsung phone car charger.  It works well and the price is low enough to buy one for every car you own.
B003A051BU	Serves its purpose, for a good price. Not as rapid as my other one that had retractable cord and was much more compact. Probably why I find this annoyingly bulky.
B003A051BU	This charger was exactly what I needed to replace my broken one. It works great, arrived fast,and was totally affordable .
B003A051BU	Great product.  Cost almost nothing.  Works great.  I have had no problems and was glad that I bought the charger.
B003A051BU	Works well and saved me money. Item was sent out quickly.  Meets all the requirement needs for a car charger
B003A051BU	This has saved my life several times. I would forget to put it on charge and would use the truck charger as a lifesaver.
B0047XUQL4	The unit arrived (postage due 32 cents.  No packing slip.  Hmm.).  I immediately tried it on my fairly new TomTom (Model: "Start").  Unfortunately It does not fit this GPS.  The actual contact looks to be correct.  The unit is solidly built. However, there is so much plastic molding around the fitting that it would not insert into the TomTom receptacle.  I am a do it yourselfer, so I took out my Dremel drill with a small grinder on it and went to work reducing the amount of plastic around the fitting, being careful to get any filings in the fitting itself (I protected the fitting with tape).  Once I had grinded down all four sides, I did succeed in getting the fitting to be inserted.  Ah, but another problem arose.  The geometry (right angle bracket) would not allow the TomTom to be in the normal vertical position when mounted in the suction cup base. The only way I could assemble it was to have the TomTom uupside down. Other GPS devices might work.  It is clear that the designer did not actually try the contacts in an actual TomTom GPS unit, at least not the TomTom Start.
B0047XUQL4	used this to replace garmin power cord that broke, and this did the trick.  reliable, really no issues with this.
B0047XUQL4	It has four adapters. This charger really worked on my Navigon GPS. It does not go into computer connection mode.
B0047XUQL4	Item is good same as original Garmin. Tried severalcord atlast found suitable work well as expected.product is worth to buy
B0047XUQL4	It works great with my garmin nuvi 750. The reason why I took 1 star off is because it does not fit my iPhone 5s. Which would have made this the perfect product for me. If there is an additional adapter end available for the iphone 5s, I would happily purchase it and give this a 5 star rating. As for the garmin, it does not send it into computer mode, and saved me from purchasing the cradle for my gps.ML
B0047XUQL4	this item arrived promptly and was very nicely packaged.  after testing it i found that it worked perfectly.  the color was plain but in good taste.  how about the price?  UNBELIEVABLE at only 4 cents.  I needed a charger immediately and paid 24.95 for the same item at a different local seller.  NOW I HAVE A GREAT BACKUP.  the price WOW!
B0047XUQL4	Very useful..Very economical and does the job! I broke my magellan car GPS and found this one a cheap alternative.Good Quality, will recommend..
B0062O258S	I use the MB612 (due for an upgrade soon) and these chargers work great...for a few months, just like most chargers.If you have a different, less destructive phone, read the reviews for those.
B0062O258S	There aren't many Android auto chargers that also have a USB output.  I now own 3 of these same chargers and they work great.  Be careful buying other chargers.
B0062O258S	This is an excellent product for the person who on the go most of the time. This plug fit's in all car plugs that i have been driving or riding inside of.Get this!!!
B0062O258S	This is a manufacturing issue, not the seller, a trouble whit the contact pin at the time to plug it in the car socket, i try different cars and nothing!! looks really nice, but useless!!
B0062O258S	I finally wised up and quit buying those cheap off brand power cords.  They would 'mysteriously' fail after only a few months. The Sprint cord has proven to be well worth the investment!
B0062O258S	Nice to be able to charge my phone in the car. Good quality and great price. Arrived fast and better than expected!!
B0062O258S	Great charger for the car, coiled cord is a little annoying and would have preferred a straight cable but a good deal none the less.
B0062O258S	We've had it for 4 months and it holds up and continues to work. Note the convenient full size USB port, too. Very nicely done. Kudos to Amazon for offering these parts at a considerably better price than the Sprint stores!
B0062O258S	It's a really good car charger i really like the blue LED lights when it's charging it works great with the SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2
B0062O258S	I can actually charge my phone and fitbit at the same time with one outlet. Love it. It looks nice
B0062O258S	work great, I am able to charge two device using one socket.  I was able to charge several different type of tablets and ipods from the usb port with no issues.
B0062O258S	Got this for my husband so he can charge his phone in the car. I love that it has a USB port in the top, so I can charge my stuff at the same time. We've had this for almost a year now and have had no problems. Great product.edit 7/9/13: the cord finally snapped, but we had it for around 1.5 years, so we feel like we got our money's worth.
B0062O258S	Excellent car charger for short money.Don't pay for the charger at the Sprint store, this is it for a lot less money.
B0062O258S	totally amazing charger with extra USB port on it! It is very nice and great price. I recommend this item for sure
