9984993175	This product while not OEM works great for the LG 300G phone. If you lost your charger, or like me end up doing a lot of last minute trips and need a second charger to keep in the to-go bag, this is the charger to get. The seller shipped the same day (Friday) I ordered, and it arrived on Monday three days ahead of estimated delivery. Decent quality, great price, and rapid delivery what else is there to say. Why pay $10 at the gas station for the same thing when you can get it on Amazon.com for less than half that!!
9984993175	i am very happy with the product. I am used to the one that comes apart and you can use the USB. but this one works just as good. thank you
9984993175	I thought I left my wall charger on an out of town trip so I went straight to Amazon and looked up my charger. This charger is a quality charger and well wurth the money. I have found my original charge now this one stays in my travel kit. Awesome.
9984993175	This item works as good as the ones you pay big bucks for at the cell phone stores, thanks alot!
9984993175	Very cheaply made, did not charge my phone, and the tip broke the second time I tried to insert it!. Not worth the money even though it isn't very expensive!
9984993175	We plugged it into the phone and charged it. When we went to remove the charger it broke were it plugged into the phone.
9984993175	I am already using this item in my car.  I keep a cell phone for emergencies and in case of an accident I can take pictures with it.  Very usefull items.
9984993175	It does what it's supposed to do. Replaced a lost charger and this was a perfect match. Lightning quick shipment!!!
9984993175	When we accidentally left our charger for our older cell phone behind, and the company that makes the phone didn't have it, Amazon did. It was reasonably priced, got here quickly and it works well.
9984993175	Arrived quickly.  Charges fast.  It was the exact model I ordered.  I was concerned that I might have to return it because it was the wrong model or didn't work for some reason.  I've used it for a couple months with no problems.Couldn't beat the price either.
9984993175	This charger is a mirco USB that didnt fit my LG300G.... i was very disappointed to discover this as it was listed to fit the LG300G and i needed in on a timeline.
9984993175	This charger doesn't work with the LG300GB fyi....lol  I was wishing...lol  I couldn't find one for my phone online so tried this one. Finally found an adaptor for the LG300GB at walmart. 4 stars just cause I'm cool like that.....lol
9984993175	Excellent charger, i purchased it for my moms cell phone,since one of my siblings misplaced the one that came with her original cell phone. This charger works out fine, and the indicator light makes a difference so that you know the unit has power going to it. I purchased two of these chargers in case my siblings misplace a charger again..
9985562003	Received in a timely fashion. Got good help from Jabra help line to set it up. Seems to work just fine.
9985562003	I ordered this item as it was advertised to be a Jabra charger. I ordered three for the 3 Jabra Cruiser 2 that I have. When I received it it was a generic charger that mobile phone uses. Amazon should not allow sellers to misadvertise the products that they are selling.
9985562003	You can't beat it for the price paid. no problems - it works as described. Yes it is made in China - I'll revise my review if I have any problems.
9985562003	The connector does not match with Jabra speakerphone. The picture does not say it clear.So actually the purchase was a waste of money.
9985562003	I purchased this charger to charge my Jabra Cruiser blue tooth for my car, and I love it. It keeps my hands free, and I can hear, and be heard adequately.Excellent price and value.
9985562003	Didn't work- but the 1's that do- I here there awesome - ill re- order. As soon as I get credit
9985562003	This product Arrived on time and works great.  I would recommend this item as a purchase. The cord could be a little longer.
9985562003	There's not much to say about this simple charger except that it works just fine. I use it to charge my Jabra Cruiser hands free device and my Blue tooth headset.
B0003033X8	so I would give this a ZERO if I couldThe item I was sent does not even LOOK like the picture above .  The item I was sent has a  round  PIN at the end  whereas the item I was supposed to receive pictured  above  has a rectangular end  and supposed to fit a SAMSUNG phone SGH x495This is just a big mess.  I will get  a refund BUT have to send the wrong item back frost  ( very time  consuming) .No one has offered to send me the CORRECT item
B0003033X8	I lost the chaerger for my samsung phone and had to find a replacement. I bought this one and it works just like the original.
B0003033X8	Product reflects Amazon - a 5 - it works well has been reliable and I know should a problem arise Amazon will do everything to resolve it
B0003033X8	I'm sorry I cant give this product the 5 Stars I wanted to give it, when I received my charger thru the mail it came great, Brand New, Sealed in a plastic bag. At first it was all good and great, but after a couple of uses, I realized it was staying stuck on my phone and harder to take off, then one of the Grey buttons you press to take out the charger got stuck inside which only made things worse. The real mest up thing is that the broken Original charger that came with my phone Still Works, and that is even after i Crushed the lil' connecter with my Wheelchair, badly damaging the tip. Now you know how weak the New Charger I Bought was. But it's ok, its not like I paid $15.oo for it, Plus the trip to the Store, Plus the Tax Fee that is always added to every Store Purchase. So that's why I'm still Happy I bought it Here at Amazon.com :) it only cost me $5.oo or around that price, but still less than $10.oo with Shipping included so I will be buying one again to give it another try. :)Thank You Amazon.com and all the Sellers that make Buying Online Possible, Save me Alot of Money, And for Giving Me Credit! :)AND PLEASE DONT LET MY EXPIRIENCE AFFECT YOUR DECISION TO BUY or Not BUY HERE, I AM A QUADRIPLEGIC AND THEREFORE GRAB THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN A NORMAL PERSON WOULD... Etc, etc, etc, you get the point. :)
B0003033X8	It works very well, why do I need more words to say it met my needs for a charter and.
B002D3D2X4	Charger is inexpensive and works well.  It was shipped and received very quickly.  Go for it!
B002D3D2X4	These are a great price..took rather long to receive due to another product being sent, over all my products I have ordered have been excellent.
B002D3D2X4	i bought a used cell phone for my daughter and the charger that came with it was so jacked up so i came on here and purchased the charger, its the exact charger i needed and works perfect! arrived to my house just when the order said it would
B002D3D2X4	Charger worked exactly like it was supposed to. Looked exactly like the original one that came with my cell phone. Had bought another after market charger which didn't work at all. Had to get a refund. This charger does everything it was supposed to. It charged my phone.
B002D3D2X4	I received the wall ac charger. It worked for one week. It is currently broke.
B002D3D2X4	When I accidentally broke my charger, I thought I would just call the ATT store and get a replacement. Wrong, they no longer carry them in any of their stores because my phone is older.  It was actually the guy at the phone store that told me to go to Amazon! AND, the price was way below what I was expecting to pay, Yay!Hey, it also works great, just like the one that came with my phone originally, same brand too.
B002D3D2X4	I don't even remember buying this thing.  I have no idea if it works or not but I want this review crap out of my account and since I can't select to delete it I have to put junk out there for poor customers to read.  Step up, Amazon.
B002D3D2X4	After my last charger broke, I ordered this one, which charged my phone exactly once before it refused to charge it any more. I now have a dead phone.
B002D3D2X4	The charger fits well, and acts normal. Other than the Quickfire having strange touch screen issues, this was a solid purchase. Recommended!
B002D3D2X4	i was very very impressed at how quick the charger came plugged it into to my att quickfire n waalaaaa perfect definetly would order more items from sf/planet thanxxx
B002D3D2X4	it works but the phone it was made for it total and utter garbage. got it second hand and cheap but its just a crappy phone
B002D3D2X4	Instead of replacing my sons cell phone, we were able to find the charger only here!  Saved us hundreds of dollars
B002D3D2X4	The original charger has a prong to "clip" the charger onto the Quickfire. This one does NOT!!! grrSoooo I have to rig it up so that the connection stay on it.It's a pain in the azz.
B002D3D2X4	I WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THE CHARGER IT TOOK A LONG TIMETO GET TO ME AND ON TOP OF THAT THE DESCRIPTION SAID NEW, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY OLD AND BROKEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHARGING PART, THIS WAS A WAIST OF MONEY AND TIME!!!
B002D3D2X4	This charger is exactly what I was looking for.  The price was good and delivery was as promised.  I would definintely buy from this site again.
B002D3D2X4	Great price, quick shipping, worked perfectly!  I liked it better than the one my phone came with.  It was just a little different but less flimsy!  I think that about sums it up!
B002D3D2X4	Perfect charger for the phone my mom had. They don't carry these at the stores anymore and I got it at reasonable price to!
B002D3D2X4	solid construction. Works well. overall, I would say this is a good product and a good buy. This is also a good value.
B002D3D2X4	my daughter didn't think we would find a charger for her phone again...needless to say she was extremely happy when it showed at the door
B002D3D2X4	Although the charger seems to be working just fine, the item was listed as "new." When it arrived, it clearly wasn't new. It had scratches on its head and the metal prongs were slightly bent. I didn't return it because I payed a decent price for it and the cost of shipping would be more than the item.BOTTOM LINE:If you advertise something as new, that's the condition in which it should arrive.
B002D3D2X4	I ordered this charger to replace the one my new puppy chewed up!  It was a great price, arrived quickly, and does its job!
B002D3D2X4	My nephew lost his charger to his QuickFire, so I ordered this online. The phone charges, now! I have no complaints.
B002HREHI0	This is the original, OEM, Blackberry headset adapter.  I have tried cheap knockoffs and they don't work because they are not usually wired correctly -- maybe you get sound but no mike capability or vice versa.  This is designed to work with a combination headset/mike like the Ety.Com 2.5mm plug version headset, which works great with cell phones and gives you plenty of volume without requiring an external amplifier (Etymotic Research now makes a 3.5mm version which should not require this adapter but won't work with iPhone 4).  This adapter has a 90 degree angle plug into the phone which is also preferred because it puts less stress on the plug and lets you easily throw the plugged-in phone into your pocket.
B002HREHI0	I purchased this so I could use standard 3.5mm headphones with a BlackBerry 8830. The 8830 requires a 2.5mm male to 3.5mm female adapter.This item is a 3.5mm male to 2.5mm female adapter.
B002HREHI0	i'm not sure these are actual blackberry adapters, frankly, bc they came in a little plastic pouch instead of a box like you'd find on the shelf of a phone store (which is what it looked like when i got my original blackberry adapter that I thought I'd lost).  I ended up finding the original, so I could compare it with these close up.  the wire on these seems a bit thinner, plus the original had the male part in-line, not at an angle.  the female end on the original is not so fat and plasticy but rather a small sleek plug.  overall my original has a weightier sturdier and sleeker feel.  i'd bet this is a knock off that they are marketing as a blackberry.however, the price was good and they seem to work fine. not sure about durability bc they are not under heavy use.  for the price i was able to get 2 so i'm not always hunting for one and my husband can use our 2.5mm boom headset w his iPhone while I'm using my headset on my blackberry.
B002HREHI0	Didn't need it for headphones....but to integrate with a cell phone audio mixer for radio broadcast.  Does the job perfectly.
B002HREHI0	This item is used to connect 2.5mm cell phone headsets to the 3.5mm jack on your cell phone.  I just got a BB Curve 8530 and bought 3 adapters.  They all work with my three different headsets.I like the right angle connector too.
B005XLFM9A	My son ripped this charger from the g-slate while it was plugged in the wall, totally destroyed the charger and now we can't replace it.  Please bring it back so we can replace it.  It is proprietary to LG and we cannot find another one.
B005XLFM9A	I have been wanting to purchase this product for so long.  Searched several stores where I live and online sites, before this came out via Amazon.  What a relief, my son's old tablet (only 1+ year old) is in use again.
B005XLFM9A	It works perfect. That was exactly what I was looking for, for a good price keep the good job thanks
B005XLFM9A	I had this product come with my LG Slate It kept my tablet charged fast and easy. I have lost it and have had to use the micro charger and I miss my adapter SO much.
B005XLFM9A	Really difficult to find this adapter! So glad I looked on Amazon. The delivery was fast and it's exactly the ONLY adapter for my tablet.
B005XLFM9A	LG decided to use a one of a kind, super-skinny tip on the charger cable for the Tmobile G-slate and these DO NOT LAST in the real world. If they could have sold a few more of these tabs the could have made a killing on  selling chargers like printer companies do on ink cartridges. Sad really because these are a really capable tab even now in 2014. But be aware that because of their design not because of flaws in manufacturing both the car charger and the home charger are really fragile. The only upside to this one is the right angle plug on the tip. If you buy the straight tip version you might as well use the 20 bucks to blow your nose and throw it in the trash. 'nuff said
B005XLFM9A	The item shipped on time and was exactly what I had ordered. If my daughter breaks another I will order again
B005XLFM9A	I had no choice on this purchase. The original adapter  broke and I needed to replace it. The prong part of the adapter is fragile, I will be taking care not to break it, but at least I know where to find a new one.
B005XLFM9A	works real good  I needed  a new  charger for my tablet but it is very expensive  hope I don't need another one any time soon
B006P61DBI	It does what is supposed to do. Charging. Not much to say about it. Like any other charger. To many word required to review such a product.
B006P61DBI	This charger works fine. It was cheap and delivered on time and in working condition. This certainly can't be a product of Washington, D.C.
B006P61DBI	Great price, works well and does the job. What can I say, if you are in need of travel charger for your cell phone get this one.
B006P61DBI	Was just what i needed ! Fit my phone perfect ! Choosing the right wall charger was very easy ! Will for sure order again !
B006P61DBI	I used it one time.  The 2nd time I went to charge my phone it would not charge.  Fast service, poor product
B006P61DBI	The light on the charger helps to let you know it is plugged in the wall correctly. Nothing like trying to charge your phone and the charger isn't even plugged into the wall.
